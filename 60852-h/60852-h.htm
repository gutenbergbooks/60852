<h3 class='c011'>WHAT’S IN A NAME?  <br /> <span class='fss'>WHY THE MAGAZINE IS CALLED “LUCIFER.”</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>What’s in a name? Very often there is more in it than the
profane is prepared to understand, or the learned mystic to
explain. It is an invisible, secret, but very potential influence
that every name carries about with it and “leaveth wherever it
goeth.” Carlyle thought that “there is much, nay, almost all, in names.”
“Could I unfold the influence of names, which are the most important
of all clothings, I were a second great Trismegistus,” he writes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The name or title of a magazine started with a definite object, is,
therefore, all important; for it is, indeed, the invisible seedgrain, which
will either grow “to be an all-over-shadowing tree” on the fruits of
which must depend the nature of the results brought about by the said
object, or the tree will wither and die. These considerations show
that the name of the present magazine—rather equivocal to orthodox
Christian ears—is due to no careless selection, but arose in consequence
of much thinking over its fitness, and was adopted as the best symbol
to express that object and the results in view.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, the first and most important, if not the sole object of the
magazine, is expressed in the line from the 1st Epistle to the Corinthians,
on its title page. It is to bring light to “the hidden things of darkness,”
(iv. 5); to show in their true aspect and their original real meaning
things and names, men and their doings and customs; it is finally to
fight prejudice, hypocrisy and shams in every nation, in every class of
Society, as in every department of life. The task is a laborious one
but it is neither impracticable nor useless, if even as an experiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, for an attempt of such nature, no better title could ever be
found than the one chosen. “Lucifer,” is the pale morning-star, the
precursor of the full blaze of the noon-day sun—the “Eosphoros” of the
Greeks. It shines timidly at dawn to gather forces and dazzle the eye
after sunset as its own brother ‘Hesperos’—the radiant evening star, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the planet Venus. No fitter symbol exists for the proposed work—that
of throwing a ray of truth on everything hidden by the darkness of
prejudice, by social or religious misconceptions; especially by that idiotic
routine in life, which, once that a certain action, a thing, a name, has
been branded by slanderous inventions, however unjust, makes <em>respectable</em>
people, so called, turn away shiveringly, refusing to even look at it from
any other aspect than the one sanctioned by public opinion. Such an
endeavour then, to force the weak-hearted to look truth straight in the
face, is helped most efficaciously by a title belonging to the category of
branded names.</p>

<p class='c001'>Piously inclined readers may argue that “Lucifer” is accepted by all
the churches as one of the many names of the Devil. According to
Milton’s superb fiction, Lucifer is <em>Satan</em>, the “rebellious” angel, the
enemy of God and man. If one analyzes his rebellion, however, it will
be found of no worse nature than an assertion of free-will and independent
thought, as if Lucifer had been born in the XIXth century. This
epithet of “rebellious,” is a theological calumny, on a par with that other
slander of God by the Predestinarians, one that makes of deity an
“Almighty” fiend worse than the “rebellious” Spirit himself; “an
omnipotent Devil desiring to be ‘complimented’ as all merciful when he
is exerting the most fiendish cruelty,” as put by J. Cotter Morison.
Both the foreordaining and predestining fiend-God, and his subordinate
agent are of human invention; they are two of the most morally repulsive
and horrible theological dogmas that the nightmares of light-hating
monks have ever evolved out of their unclean fancies.</p>

<p class='c001'>They date from the Mediæval age, the period of mental obscuration,
during which most of the present prejudices and superstitions have been
forcibly inoculated on the human mind, so as to have become nearly
ineradicable in some cases, one of which is the present prejudice now
under discussion.</p>

<p class='c001'>So deeply rooted, indeed, is this preconception and aversion to the name
of Lucifer—meaning no worse than “light-bringer” (from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lux</i></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lucis</i></span>,
“light,” and <i>ferre</i> “to bring”)<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a>—even among the educated classes, that
by adopting it for the title of their magazine the editors have the
prospect of a long strife with public prejudice before them. So absurd
and ridiculous is that prejudice, indeed, that no one has seemed to ever
ask himself the question, how came Satan to be called a <em>light-bringer</em>,
unless the silvery rays of the morning-star can in any way be made
suggestive of the glare of the infernal flames. It is simply, as Henderson
showed, “one of those gross perversions of sacred writ which so extensively
obtain, and which are to be traced to a proneness to seek for more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>in a given passage than it really contains—a disposition to be influenced
by sound rather than sense, and an implicit faith in received interpretation”—which
is not quite one of the weaknesses of our present age.
Nevertheless, the prejudice is there, to the shame of our century.</p>

<p class='c001'>This cannot be helped. The two editors would hold themselves as
recreants in their own sight, as traitors to the very spirit of the proposed
work, were they to yield and cry craven before the danger. If one
would fight prejudice, and brush off the ugly cobwebs of superstition
and materialism alike from the noblest ideals of our forefathers, one has
to prepare for opposition. “The crown of the reformer and the innovator
is a crown of thorns” indeed. If one would rescue Truth in all her
chaste nudity from the almost bottomless well, into which she has been
hurled by cant and hypocritical propriety, one should not hesitate to
descend into the dark, gaping pit of that well. No matter how badly
the blind bats—the dwellers in darkness, and the haters of light—may
treat in their gloomy abode the intruder, unless one is the first to show
the spirit and courage he preaches to others, he must be justly held as a
hypocrite and a seceder from his own principles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hardly had the title been agreed upon, when the first premonitions of
what was in store for us, in the matter of the opposition to be
encountered owing to the title chosen, appeared on our horizon. One
of the editors received and recorded some spicy objections. The scenes
that follow are sketches from nature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><i>A Well-known Novelist.</i> Tell me about your new magazine. What class do you
propose to appeal to?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> No class in particular: we intend to appeal to the public.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Novelist.</i> I am very glad of that. For once I shall be one of the public, for
I don’t understand your subject in the least, and I want to. But you must remember
that if your public is to understand you, it must necessarily be a very small one.
People talk about occultism nowadays as they talk about many other things, without
the least idea of what it means. We are so ignorant and—so prejudiced.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Exactly. That is what calls the new magazine into existence. We
propose to educate you, and to tear the mask from every prejudice.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Novelist.</i> That really is good news to me, for I want to be educated. What is
your magazine to be called?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Novelist.</i> What! Are you going to educate us in vice? We know enough about
that. Fallen angels are plentiful. You may find popularity, for soiled doves are in
fashion just now, while the white-winged angels are voted a bore, because they are not
so amusing. But I doubt your being able to teach us much.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>II.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><i>A Man of the World</i> (<em>in a careful undertone, for the scene is a dinner-party</em>). I
hear you are going to start a magazine, all about occultism. Do you know, I’m very
glad. I don’t say anything about such matters as a rule, but some queer things have
happened in my life which can’t be explained in any ordinary manner. I hope you
will go in for explanations.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><i>Editor.</i> We shall try, certainly. My impression is, that when occultism is in any
measure apprehended, its laws are accepted by everyone as the only intelligible
explanation of life.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A M. W.</i> Just so, I want to know all about it, for ’pon my honour, life’s a mystery.
There are plenty of other people as curious as myself. This is an age which is afflicted
with the Yankee disease of ‘wanting to know.’ I’ll get you lots of subscribers. What’s
the magazine called?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Lucifer—and (<em>warned by former experience</em>) don’t misunderstand the
name. It is typical of the divine spirit which sacrificed itself for humanity—it was
Milton’s doing that it ever became associated with the devil. We are sworn enemies
to popular prejudices, and it is quite appropriate that we should attack such a
prejudice as this—Lucifer, you know, is the Morning Star—the Lightbearer,...</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A M. W.</i> (<em>interrupting</em>). Oh, I know all that—at least I don’t know, but I take
it for granted you’ve got some good reason for taking such a title. But your first
object is to have readers; you want the public to buy your magazine, I suppose.
That’s in the programme, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Most decidedly.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A M. W.</i> Well, listen to the advice of a man who knows his way about town.
Don’t mark your magazine with the wrong colour at starting. It’s quite evident, when
one stays an instant to think of its derivation and meaning, that Lucifer is an excellent
word. But the public don’t stay to think of derivations and meanings; and the first
impression is the most important. Nobody will buy the magazine if you call it
Lucifer.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>III.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><i>A Fashionable Lady Interested in Occultism.</i> I want to hear some more about the
new magazine, for I have interested a great many people in it, even with the little you
have told me. But I find it difficult to express its actual purpose. What is it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> To try and give a little light to those that want it.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A F. L.</i> Well, that’s a simple way of putting it, and will be very useful to me.
What is the magazine to be called?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A F. L.</i> (<em>After a pause</em>) You can’t mean it.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Why not?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A F. L.</i> The associations are so dreadful! What can be the object of calling it
that? It sounds like some unfortunate sort of joke, made against it by its enemies.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Oh, but Lucifer, you know, means Light-bearer; it is typical of the Divine
Spirit——</p>

<p class='c001'><i>A F. L.</i> Never mind all that—I want to do your magazine good and make it
known, and you can’t expect me to enter into explanations of that sort every time I
mention the title? Impossible! Life is too short and too busy. Besides, it would
produce such a bad effect; people would think me priggish, and then I couldn’t talk at
all, for I couldn’t bear them to think that. Don’t call it Lucifer—please don’t. Nobody
knows what the word is typical of; what it means now is the devil, nothing more or less.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> But then that is quite a mistake, and one of the first prejudices we propose
to do battle with. Lucifer is the pale, pure herald of dawn——</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Lady</i> (<em>interrupting</em>). I thought you were going to do something more interesting
and more important than to whitewash mythological characters. We shall all have to
go to school again, or read up Dr. Smith’s Classical Dictionary. And what is the use
of it when it is done? I thought you were going to tell us things about our own lives
and how to make them better. I suppose Milton wrote about Lucifer, didn’t he?—but
nobody reads Milton now. Do let us have a modern title with some human meaning
in it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>IV.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><i>A Journalist</i> (<em>thoughtfully, while rolling his cigarette</em>). Yes, it is a good idea, this
magazine of yours. We shall all laugh at it, as a matter of course: and we shall cut
it up in the papers. But we shall all read it, because secretly everybody hungers after
the mysterious. What are you going to call it?</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Editor.</i> Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c001'><i>Journalist</i> (<em>striking a light</em>). Why not <cite>The Fusee</cite>? Quite as good a title and not
so pretentious.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The “Novelist,” the “Man of the World,” the “Fashionable Lady,”
and the “Journalist,” should be the first to receive a little instruction.
A glimpse into the real and primitive character of Lucifer can do them
no harm and may, perchance, cure them of a bit of ridiculous prejudice.
They ought to study their Homer and Hesiod’s Theogony if they would
do justice to Lucifer, “<em>Eosphoros and Hesperos</em>,” the Morning and the
Evening beautiful star. If there are more useful things to do in this
life than “to whitewash mythological characters,” to slander and blacken
them is, at least, as useless, and shows, moreover, a narrow-mindedness
which can do honour to no one.</p>

<p class='c001'>To object to the title of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, only because its “associations are
so dreadful,” is pardonable—if it can be pardonable in any case—only
in an ignorant American missionary of some dissenting sect, in one
whose natural laziness and lack of education led him to prefer ploughing
the minds of heathens, as ignorant as he is himself, to the more
profitable, but rather more arduous, process of ploughing the fields of his
own father’s farm. In the English clergy, however, who receive all a
more or less classical education, and are, therefore, supposed to be
acquainted with the <em>ins</em> and <em>outs</em> of theological sophistry and casuistry,
this kind of opposition is absolutely unpardonable. It not only smacks
of hypocrisy and deceit, but places them directly on a lower moral level
than him they call the apostate angel. By endeavouring to show the
theological Lucifer, fallen through the idea that</p>

      <div class='line'>Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven,”</div>

<p class='c015'>they are virtually putting into practice the supposed crime they would
fain accuse him of. They prefer reigning over the spirit of the masses
by means of a pernicious dark <span class='fss'>LIE</span>, productive of many an evil, than
serve heaven by serving <span class='fss'>TRUTH</span>. Such practices are worthy only of the
Jesuits.</p>

<p class='c001'>But their sacred writ is the first to contradict their interpretations and
the association of Lucifer, the Morning Star, with Satan. Chapter
XXII. of <cite>Revelation</cite>, verse 16th, says: “I, Jesus ... am the
root ... and the bright and <em>Morning Star</em>” (ὀρθρινὸς “early rising”):
hence Eosphoros, or the Latin Lucifer. The opprobrium attached to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>this name is of such a very late date, that the Roman Church found
itself forced to screen the theological slander behind a two-sided
interpretation—as usual. Christ, we are told, is the “Morning Star,”
the <em>divine</em> Lucifer; and Satan the <em>usurpator</em> of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Verbum</i></span>, the “infernal
Lucifer.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> “The great Archangel Michael, the conqueror of Satan, is
identical in paganism<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with Mercury-Mithra, to whom, after defending
the Sun (symbolical of God) from the attacks of Venus-Lucifer, was
given the possession of this planet, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et datus est ei locus Luciferi</i></span>.
And since the Archangel Michael is the ‘Angel of the Face,’ and ‘the
Vicar of the <em>Verbum</em>’ he is now considered in the Roman Church as
the regent of that planet Venus which ‘the vanquished fiend had
usurped.’” <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Angelus faciei Dei sedem superbi humilis obtinuit</i></span>, says
Cornelius à Lapide (in Vol. VI. p. 229).</p>

<p class='c001'>This gives the reason why one of the early Popes was called Lucifer,
as Yonge and ecclesiastical records prove. It thus follows that the title
chosen for our magazine is as much associated with divine and pious
ideas as with the supposed rebellion of the hero of Milton’s “Paradise
Lost.” By choosing it, <em>we throw the first ray of light and truth</em> on a
ridiculous prejudice which ought to have no room made for it in this our
“age of facts and discovery.” We work for true Religion and Science,
in the interest of fact as against fiction and prejudice. It is our duty, as
it is that of physical Science—professedly its mission—to throw light on
facts in Nature hitherto surrounded by the darkness of ignorance. And
since ignorance is justly regarded as the chief promoter of superstition,
that work is, therefore, a noble and beneficent work. But natural
Sciences are only one aspect of <span class='sc'>Science</span> and <span class='sc'>Truth</span>. Psychological
and moral Sciences, or theosophy, the knowledge of divine truth,
wheresoever found, are still more important in human affairs, and real
Science should not be limited simply to the physical aspect of life and
nature. Science is an abstract of every fact, a comprehension of every
truth within the scope of human research and intelligence. “Shakespeare’s
deep and accurate science in mental philosophy” (Coleridge),
has proved more beneficent to the true philosopher in the study of the
human heart—therefore, in the promotion of truth—than the more
accurate, but certainly less deep, science of any Fellow of the Royal
Institution.</p>

<p class='c001'>Those readers, however, who do not find themselves convinced that the
Church had no right to throw a slur upon a beautiful star, and that it did
so through a mere necessity of accounting for one of its numerous loans
from Paganism with all its poetical conceptions of the truths in Nature,
are asked to read our article “The History of a Planet.” Perhaps, after
its perusal, they will see how far Dupuis was justified in asserting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“all the theologies have their origin in astronomy.” With the modern
Orientalists every myth is <em>solar</em>. This is one more prejudice, and a
preconception in favour of materialism and physical science. It will be
one of our duties to combat it with much of the rest.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c019'>It should be very clearly remembered by all readers of this volume
that it is a book which may appear to have some little philosophy
in it, but very little sense, to those who believe it to be written in
ordinary English. To the many, who read in this manner it will be—not
caviare so much as olives strong of their salt. Be warned and read
but a little in this way.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another way of reading, which is, indeed, the only one of
any use with many authors. It is reading, not between the lines but
within the words. In fact, it is deciphering a profound cipher.
All alchemical works are written in the cipher of which I speak; it has
been used by the great philosophers and poets of all time. It is used
systematically by the adepts in life and knowledge, who, seemingly
giving out their deepest wisdom, hide in the very words which frame
it its actual mystery. They cannot do more. There is a law of nature
which insists that a man shall read these mysteries for himself. By no
other method can he obtain them. A man who desires to live must
eat his food himself: this is the simple law of nature—which applies
also to the higher life. A man who would live and act in it cannot
be fed like a babe with a spoon; he must eat for himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I propose to put into new and sometimes plainer language parts of
“Light on the Path”; but whether this effort of mine will really
be any interpretation I cannot say. To a deaf and dumb man, a
truth is made no more intelligible if, in order to make it so, some misguided
linguist translates the words in which it is couched into every
living or dead language, and shouts these different phrases in his
ear. But for those who are not deaf and dumb one language is generally
easier than the rest; and it is to such as these I address myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The very first aphorisms of “Light on the Path,” included under
Number I. have, I know well, remained sealed as to their inner meaning
to many who have otherwise followed the purpose of the book.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are four proven and certain truths with regard to the entrance
to occultism. The Gates of Gold bar that threshold; yet there are some
who pass those gates and discover the sublime and illimitable beyond.
In the far spaces of Time all will pass those gates. But I am one
who wish that Time, the great deluder, were not so over-masterful. To
those who know and love him I have no word to say; but to the
others—and there are not so very few as some may fancy—to whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>passage of Time is as the stroke of a sledge-hammer, and the sense of
Space like the bars of an iron cage, I will translate and re-translate
until they understand fully.</p>

<p class='c001'>The four truths written on the first page of “Light on the Path,” refer
to the trial initiation of the would-be occultist. Until he has passed
it, he cannot even reach to the latch of the gate which admits to knowledge.
Knowledge is man’s greatest inheritance; why, then, should
he not attempt to reach it by every possible road? The laboratory
is not the only ground for experiment; <em>science</em>, we must remember,
is derived from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sciens</i></span>, present participle of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>scire</i></span>, “to know,”—its origin
is similar to that of the word “discern,” “to ken.” Science does
not therefore deal only with matter, no, not even its subtlest and
obscurest forms. Such an idea is born merely of the idle spirit of
the age. Science is a word which covers all forms of knowledge.
It is exceedingly interesting to hear what chemists discover, and to see
them finding their way through the densities of matter to its finer
forms; but there are other kinds of knowledge than this, and it is not
every one who restricts his (strictly scientific) desire for knowledge to
experiments which are capable of being tested by the physical senses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everyone who is not a dullard, or a man stupefied by some predominant
vice, has guessed, or even perhaps discovered with some
certainty, that there are subtle senses lying within the physical
senses. There is nothing at all extraordinary in this; if we took the
trouble to call Nature into the witness box we should find that everything
which is perceptible to the ordinary sight, has something even
more important than itself hidden within it; the microscope has opened
a world to us, but within those encasements which the microscope
reveals, lies a mystery which no machinery can probe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole world is animated and lit, down to its most material
shapes, by a world within it. This inner world is called Astral by some
people, and it is as good a word as any other, though it merely
means starry; but the stars, as Locke pointed out, are luminous
bodies which give light of themselves. This quality is characteristic
of the life which lies within matter; for those who see it, need no
lamp to see it by. The word star, moreover, is derived from the
Anglo-Saxon “stir-an,” to steer, to stir, to move, and undeniably it is
the inner life which is master of the outer, just as a man’s brain
guides the movements of his lips. So that although Astral is no very
excellent word in itself, I am content to use it for my present purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The whole of “Light on the Path” is written in an astral cipher and
can therefore only be deciphered by one who reads astrally. And its
teaching is chiefly directed towards the cultivation and development
of the astral life. Until the first step has been taken in this development,
the swift knowledge, which is called intuition with certainty, is impossible
to man. And this positive and certain intuition is the only form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>knowledge which enables a man to work rapidly or reach his true and
high estate, within the limit of his conscious effort. To obtain knowledge
by experiment is too tedious a method for those who aspire to
accomplish real work; he who gets it by certain intuition, lays hands on
its various forms with supreme rapidity, by fierce effort of will; as a
determined workman grasps his tools, indifferent to their weight or
any other difficulty which may stand in his way. He does not stay for
each to be tested—he uses such as he sees are fittest.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the rules contained in “Light on the Path,” are written for all
disciples, but only for disciples—those who “take knowledge.” To none
else but the student in this school are its laws of any use or interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>To all who are interested seriously in Occultism, I say first—take
knowledge. To him who hath shall be given. It is useless to wait for it.
The womb of Time will close before you, and in later days you will remain
unborn, without power. I therefore say to those who have any
hunger or thirst for knowledge, attend to these rules.</p>

<p class='c001'>They are none of my handicraft or invention. They are merely the
phrasing of laws in super-nature, the putting into words truths as absolute
in their own sphere, as those laws which govern the conduct of the earth
and its atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c001'>The senses spoken of in these four statements are the astral, or inner
senses.</p>

<p class='c001'>No man desires to see that light which illumines the spaceless soul
until pain and sorrow and despair have driven him away from the life of
ordinary humanity. First he wears out pleasure; then he wears out pain—till,
at last, his eyes become incapable of tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is a truism, although I know perfectly well that it will meet with
a vehement denial from many who are in sympathy with thoughts which
spring from the inner life. <em>To see</em> with the astral sense of sight is a form
of activity which it is difficult for us to understand immediately. The
scientist knows very well what a miracle is achieved by each child that is
born into the world, when it first conquers its eye-sight and compels it
to obey its brain. An equal miracle is performed with each sense
certainly, but this ordering of sight is perhaps the most stupendous effort.
Yet the child does it almost unconsciously, by force of the powerful
heredity of habit. No one now is aware that he has ever done it at all;
just as we cannot recollect the individual movements which enabled us to
walk up a hill a year ago. This arises from the fact that we move and
live and have our being in matter. Our knowledge of it has become
intuitive.</p>

<p class='c001'>With our astral life it is very much otherwise. For long ages past,
man has paid very little attention to it—so little, that he has practically
lost the use of his senses. It is true, that in every civilization the star
arises, and man confesses, with more or less of folly and confusion, that
he knows himself to be. But most often he denies it, and in being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>materialist becomes that strange thing, a being which cannot see its own
light, a thing of life which will not live, an astral animal which has eyes,
and ears, and speech, and power, yet will use none of these gifts. This
is the case, and the habit of ignorance has become so confirmed, that
now none will see with the inner vision till agony has made the physical
eyes not only unseeing, but without tears—the moisture of life. To be
incapable of tears is to have faced and conquered the simple human
nature, and to have attained an equilibrium which cannot be shaken by
personal emotions. It does not imply any hardness of heart, or any
indifference. It does not imply the exhaustion of sorrow, when the
suffering soul seems powerless to suffer acutely any longer; it does not
mean the deadness of old age, when emotion is becoming dull because
the strings which vibrate to it are wearing out. None of these conditions
are fit for a disciple, and if any one of them exist in him, it must be
overcome before the path can be entered upon. Hardness of heart
belongs to the selfish man, the egotist, to whom the gate is for ever closed.
Indifference belongs to the fool and the false philosopher; those whose
lukewarmness makes them mere puppets, not strong enough to face the
realities of existence. When pain or sorrow has worn out the keenness
of suffering, the result is a lethargy not unlike that which accompanies
old age, as it is usually experienced by men and women. Such a condition
makes the entrance to the path impossible, because the first step
is one of difficulty and needs a strong man, full of psychic and physical
vigour, to attempt it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a truth, that, as Edgar Allan Poe said, the eyes are the windows
for the soul, the windows of that haunted palace in which it dwells.
This is the very nearest interpretation into ordinary language of
the meaning of the text. If grief, dismay, disappointment or
pleasure, can shake the soul so that it loses its fixed hold on the calm
spirit which inspires it, and the moisture of life breaks forth, drowning
knowledge in sensation, then all is blurred, the windows are darkened,
the light is useless. This is as literal a fact as that if a man, at the edge
of a precipice, loses his nerve through some sudden emotion he will
certainly fall. The poise of the body, the balance, must be preserved,
not only in dangerous places, but even on the level ground, and with
all the assistance Nature gives us by the law of gravitation. So it is
with the soul, it is the link between the outer body and the starry spirit
beyond; the divine spark dwells in the still place where no convulsion
of Nature can shake the air; this is so always. But the soul may lose
its hold on that, its knowledge of it, even though these two are part of
one whole; and it is by emotion, by sensation, that this hold is loosed.
To suffer either pleasure or pain, causes a vivid vibration which is, to
the consciousness of man, life. Now this sensibility does not lessen
when the disciple enters upon his training; it increases. It is the
first test of his strength; he must suffer, must enjoy or endure, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>keenly than other men, while yet he has taken on him a duty which
does not exist for other men, that of not allowing his suffering to
shake him from his fixed purpose. He has, in fact, at the first step
to take himself steadily in hand and put the bit into his own mouth;
no one else can do it for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first four aphorisms of “Light on the Path,” refer entirely to astral
development. This development must be accomplished to a certain extent—that
is to say it must be fully entered upon—before the remainder
of the book is really intelligible except to the intellect; in fact, before it
can be read as a practical, not a metaphysical treatise.</p>

<p class='c001'>In one of the great mystic Brotherhoods, there are four ceremonies,
that take place early in the year, which practically illustrate and
elucidate these aphorisms. They are ceremonies in which only novices
take part, for they are simply services of the threshold. But it will
show how serious a thing it is to become a disciple, when it is
understood that these are all ceremonies of sacrifice. The first one
is this of which I have been speaking. The keenest enjoyment, the
bitterest pain, the anguish of loss and despair, are brought to bear on
the trembling soul, which has not yet found light in the darkness,
which is helpless as a blind man is, and until these shocks can be
endured without loss of equilibrium the astral senses must remain
sealed. This is the merciful law. The “medium,” or “spiritualist,”
who rushes into the psychic world without preparation, is a law-breaker,
a breaker of the laws of super-nature. Those who break
Nature’s laws lose their physical health; those who break the laws of
the inner life, lose their psychic health. “Mediums” become mad,
suicides, miserable creatures devoid of moral sense; and often end as
unbelievers, doubters even of that which their own eyes have seen.
The disciple is compelled to become his own master before he
adventures on this perilous path, and attempts to face those beings
who live and work in the astral world, and whom we call masters,
because of their great knowledge and their ability to control not only
themselves but the forces around them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The condition of the soul when it lives for the life of sensation as
distinguished from that of knowledge, is vibratory or oscillating, as
distinguished from fixed. That is the nearest literal representation of
the fact; but it is only literal to the intellect, not to the intuition.
For this part of man’s consciousness a different vocabulary is needed.
The idea of “fixed” might perhaps be transposed into that of “at
home.” In sensation no permanent home can be found, because change
is the law of this vibratory existence. That fact is the first one which
must be learned by the disciple. It is useless to pause and weep for
a scene in a kaleidoscope which has passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a very well-known fact, one with which Bulwer Lytton dealt
with great power, that an intolerable sadness is the very first experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of the neophyte in Occultism. A sense of blankness falls
upon him which makes the world a waste, and life a vain exertion.
This follows his first serious contemplation of the abstract. In gazing,
or even in attempting to gaze, on the ineffable mystery of his own
higher nature, he himself causes the initial trial to fall on him. The
oscillation between pleasure and pain ceases for—perhaps an instant
of time; but that is enough to have cut him loose from his fast
moorings in the world of sensation. He has experienced, however
briefly, the greater life; and he goes on with ordinary existence
weighted by a sense of unreality, of blank, of horrid negation. This
was the nightmare which visited Bulwer Lytton’s neophyte in
“Zanoni”; and even Zanoni himself, who had learned great truths,
and been entrusted with great powers, had not actually passed the
threshold where fear and hope, despair and joy seem at one moment
absolute realities, at the next mere forms of fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This initial trial is often brought on us by life itself. For life is
after all, the great teacher. We return to study it, after we have
acquired power over it, just as the master in chemistry learns more
in the laboratory than his pupil does. There are persons so near
the door of knowledge that life itself prepares them for it, and no
individual hand has to invoke the hideous guardian of the entrance.
These must naturally be keen and powerful organizations, capable
of the most vivid pleasure; then pain comes and fills its great duty.
The most intense forms of suffering fall on such a nature, till at last
it arouses from its stupor of consciousness, and by the force of its
internal vitality steps over the threshold into a place of peace. Then
the vibration of life loses its power of tyranny. The sensitive nature
must suffer still; but the soul has freed itself and stands aloof, guiding
the life towards its greatness. Those who are the subjects of
Time, and go slowly through all his spaces, live on through a long-drawn
series of sensations, and suffer a constant mingling of pleasure
and of pain. They do not dare to take the snake of self in a steady
grasp and conquer it, so becoming divine; but prefer to go on fretting
through divers experiences, suffering blows from the opposing
forces.</p>

<p class='c001'>When one of these subjects of Time decides to enter on the path of
Occultism, it is this which is his first task. If life has not taught it
to him, if he is not strong enough to teach himself, and if he has
power enough to demand the help of a master, then this fearful trial,
depicted in Zanoni, is put upon him. The oscillation in which he
lives, is for an instant stilled; and he has to survive the shock of
facing what seems to him at first sight as the abyss of nothingness.
Not till he has learned to dwell in this abyss, and has found its
peace, is it possible for his eyes to have become incapable of tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty of writing intelligibly on these subjects is so great that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>I beg of those who have found any interest in this article, and are yet
left with perplexities and doubts, to address me in the correspondence

fields of the night sky, shines so dazzlingly as the planet Venus—not
even Sirius-Sothis, the dog-star, beloved by Isis. Venus

She is the inspirer of the poet, the guardian and companion of the lonely

<p class='c015'>although their secrets are still untold and unrevealed to the majority of
men, including astronomers. They are “a beauty and a mystery,” verily.
But “where there is a mystery, it is generally supposed that there must
also be evil,” says Byron. Evil, therefore, was detected by evilly-disposed
human fancy, even in those bright luminous eyes peeping at our wicked
world through the veil of ether. Thus there came to exist slandered
stars and planets as well as slandered men and women. Too often
are the reputation and fortune of one man or party sacrificed for the
benefit of another man or party. As on earth below, so in the heavens
above, and Venus, the sister planet of our Earth,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> was sacrificed to the
ambition of our little globe to show the latter the “chosen” planet of the
Lord. She became the scapegoat, the <em>Azaziel</em> of the starry dome, for the
sins of the Earth, or rather for those of a certain class in the human
family—the clergy—who slandered the bright orb, in order to prove
what their ambition suggested to them as the best means to reach
power, and exercise it unswervingly over the superstitious and ignorant
masses.</p>

<p class='c001'>This took place during the middle ages. And now the sin lies black
at the door of Christians and their scientific inspirers, though the error
was successfully raised to the lofty position of a religious dogma, as
many other fictions and inventions have been.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indeed, the whole sidereal world, planets and their regents—the
ancient gods of poetical paganism—the sun, the moon, the elements,
and the entire host of incalculable worlds—those at least which happened
to be known to the Church Fathers—shared in the same fate. They
have all been slandered, all bedevilled by the insatiable desire of
proving one little system of theology—built on and constructed out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>old pagan materials—the only right and holy one, and all those which
preceded or followed it utterly wrong. Sun and stars, the very air
itself, we are asked to believe, became pure and “redeemed” from
original sin and the Satanic element of heathenism, only after the year
I, A.D. Scholastics and scholiasts, the spirit of whom “spurned laborious
investigation and slow induction,” had shown, to the satisfaction of
infallible Church, the whole Kosmos in the power of Satan—a poor
compliment to God—before the year of the Nativity; and Christians
had to believe or be condemned. Never have subtle sophistry and
casuistry shown themselves so plainly in their true light, however, as in
the questions of the ex-Satanism and later redemption of various
heavenly bodies. Poor beautiful Venus got worsted in that war of so-called
divine proofs to a greater degree than any of her sidereal colleagues.
While the history of the other six planets, and their gradual
transformation from Greco-Aryan gods into Semitic devils, and finally
into “divine attributes of the <em>seven eyes</em> of the Lord,” is known but to
the educated, that of Venus-Lucifer has become a household story
among even the most illiterate in Roman Catholic countries.</p>

<p class='c001'>This story shall now be told for the benefit of those who may have
neglected their astral mythology.</p>

<p class='c001'>Venus, characterised by Pythagoras as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sol alter</i></span>, a second Sun, on
account of her magnificent radiance—equalled by none other—was the
first to draw the attention of ancient Theogonists. Before it began to
be called Venus, it was known in <em>pre</em>-Hesiodic theogony as Eosphoros
(or Phosphoros) and Hesperos, the children of the dawn and twilight. In
Hesiod, moreover, the planet is decomposed into two divine beings,
two brothers—Eosphoros (the <em>Lucifer</em> of the Latins) the morning, and
Hesperos, the evening star. They are the children of Astrœos and
Eos, the starry heaven and the dawn, as also of Kephalos and Eos
(<cite>Theog:</cite> 381, <cite>Hyg: Poet: Astron</cite>: 11, 42). Preller, quoted by Decharme,
shows Phaeton identical with Phosphoros or Lucifer (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Griech: Mythol</cite></span>:
1. 365). And on the authority of Hesiod he also makes Phaeton the son
of the latter two divinities—Kephalos and Eos.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now Phaeton or Phosphoros, the “luminous morning orb,” is carried
away in his early youth by Aphrodite (Venus) who makes of him the
night guardian of her sanctuary (<cite>Theog:</cite> 987-991). He is the “beautiful
morning star” (<i>Vide</i> St. John’s <cite>Revelation</cite> XXII. 16) loved for its radiant
light by the Goddess of the Dawn, Aurora, who, while gradually eclipsing
the light of her beloved, thus seeming to carry off the star, makes it
reappear on the evening horizon where it watches the gates of heaven.
In early morning, Phosphoros “issuing from the waters of the Ocean,
raises in heaven his sacred head to announce the approach of divine
light.” (<cite>Iliad</cite>, XXIII. 226; <cite>Odyss:</cite> XIII. 93; Virg: <cite>Æneid</cite>, VIII. 589;
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mythol: de la Grèce Antique</cite></span>. 247). He holds a torch in his hand and
flies through space as he precedes the car of Aurora. In the evening he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>becomes Hesperos, “the most splendid of the stars that shine on the
celestial vault” (<cite>Iliad</cite>, XXII. 317). He is the father of the Hesperides,
the guardians of the golden apples together with the Dragon; the
beautiful genius of the flowing golden curls, sung and glorified in all the
ancient <em>epithalami</em> (the bridal songs of the early Christians as of the
pagan Greeks); he, who at the fall of the night, leads the nuptial
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cortège</i></span> and delivers the bride into the arms of the bridegroom. (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Carmen
Nuptiale.</i></span> See <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Mythol: de la Grèce Antique</cite></span>. Decharme.)</p>

<p class='c001'>So far, there seems to be no possible <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rapprochement</i></span>, no analogy to be
discovered between this poetical personification of a star, a purely
astronomical myth, and the <em>Satanism</em> of Christian theology. True, the
close connection between the planet as Hesperos, the evening star, and
the Greek Garden of Eden with its Dragon and the golden apples may,
with a certain stretch of imagination, suggest some painful comparisons
with the third chapter of Genesis. But this is insufficient to justify the
building of a theological wall of defence against paganism made up of
slander and misrepresentations.</p>

<p class='c001'>But of all the Greek <em>euhemerisations</em>, Lucifer-Eosphoros is, perhaps,
the most complicated. The planet has become with the Latins, Venus,
or Aphrodite-<em>Anadyomene</em>, the foam-born Goddess, the “Divine Mother,”
and one with the Phœnician Astarte, or the Jewish Astaroth. They
were all called “The Morning Star,” and the Virgins of the Sea, or <em>Mar</em>
(whence Mary), the great Deep, titles now given by the Roman Church
to their Virgin Mary. They were all connected with the moon and the
crescent, with the Dragon and the planet Venus, as the mother of Christ
has been made connected with all these attributes. If the Phœnician
mariners carried, fixed on the prow of their ships, the image of the goddess
Astarte (or Aphrodite, Venus Erycina) and looked upon the evening
and the morning star as <em>their</em> guiding star, “the eye of their Goddess
mother,” so do the Roman Catholic sailors the same to this day. They
fix a Madonna on the prows of their vessels, and the blessed Virgin
Mary is called the “Virgin of the Sea.” The accepted patroness of
Christian sailors, their star, “<em>Stella Del Mar</em>,” etc., she stands on the
crescent moon. Like the old pagan Goddesses, she is the “Queen of
Heaven,” and the “Morning Star” just as they were.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether this can explain anything, is left to the reader’s sagacity.
Meanwhile, Lucifer-Venus has nought to do with darkness, and everything
with light. When called <em>Lucifer</em>, it is the “light bringer,” the first
radiant beam which destroys the lethal darkness of night. When named
Venus, the planet-star becomes the symbol of dawn, the chaste Aurora.
Professor Max Müller rightly conjectures that Aphrodite, born of the
sea, is a personification of the Dawn of Day, and the most lovely of all
the sights in Nature (“Science of Language”) for, before her naturalisation
by the Greeks, Aphrodite was Nature personified, the life and light
of the Pagan world, as proven in the beautiful invocation to Venus by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Lucretius, quoted by Decharme. She is <em>divine</em> Nature in her entirety,
<em>Aditi-Prakriti</em> before she becomes Lakshmi. She is that Nature before
whose majestic and fair face, “the winds fly away, the quieted sky pours
torrents of light, and the sea-waves smile,” (Lucretius). When referred
to as the Syrian goddess Astarte, the Astaroth of Hieropolis, the
radiant planet was personified as a majestic woman, holding in one
outstretched hand a torch, in the other, a crooked staff in the form of
a cross. (<i>Vide</i> Lucian’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Dea Syriê</cite></span>, and Cicero’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Nat: Deorum</cite></span>,
3 c.23). Finally, the planet is represented astronomically, as a globe
<em>poised above the cross</em>—a symbol no devil would like to associate with—while
the planet Earth is a globe with a cross <em>over it</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then, these crosses are not the symbols of Christianity, but the
Egyptian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>crux ansata</i></span>, the attribute of Isis (who is Venus, and Aphrodite,
Nature, also) ♀ or ♀ the planet; the fact that the Earth has the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>crux
ansata</i></span> reversed, ♁ having a great occult significance upon which there
is no necessity of entering at present.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now what says the Church and how does it explain the “dreadful
association.” The Church believes in the devil, of course, and could not
afford to lose him. “<em>The Devil is the chief pillar of the Church</em>” confesses
unblushingly an advocate<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the <cite>Ecclesia Militans</cite>. “All the Alexandrian
Gnostics speak to us of the fall of the Æons and their Pleroma, and
all attribute that fall <em>to the desire to know</em>,” writes another volunteer in
the same army, slandering the Gnostics as usual and identifying <em>the
desire to know</em> or occultism, magic, with Satanism.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a> And then, forthwith,
he quotes from Schlegel’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Philosophie de l’Histoire</cite></span> to show that the seven
rectors (planets) of Pymander, “commissioned by God to contain the
phenomenal world in their seven circles, lost in love with their own
beauty,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c013'><sup>[7]</sup></a> came to admire themselves with such intensity that owing to
this proud self-adulation they finally <em>fell</em>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Perversity having thus found its way amongst the angels, the most
beautiful creature of God “revolted against its Maker.” That creature
is in theological fancy Venus-Lucifer, or rather the informing Spirit or
Regent of that planet. This teaching is based on the following speculation.
The three principal heroes of the great sidereal catastrophe
mentioned in <cite>Revelation</cite> are, according to the testimony of the Church
fathers—“the Verbum, Lucifer his usurper (see editorial) and the grand
Archangel who conquered him,” and whose “palaces” (the “houses”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>astrology calls them) are in the Sun, Venus-Lucifer and Mercury. This is
quite evident, since the position of these orbs in the Solar system correspond
in their hierarchical order to that of the “heroes” in Chapter xii of
<cite>Revelation</cite> “their names and destinies (?) being closely connected in
the theological (exoteric) system with these three great metaphysical
names.” (De Mirville’s <cite>Memoir</cite> to the Academy of France, on the
rapping Spirits and the Demons).</p>

<p class='c001'>The outcome of this was, that theological legend made of Venus-Lucifer
the sphere and domain of the fallen Archangel, or Satan before his
apostacy. Called upon to reconcile this statement with that other fact,
that the metaphor of “the morning star,” is applied to both Jesus, and his
Virgin mother, and that the planet Venus-Lucifer is included, moreover,
among the “stars” of the seven planetary spirits worshipped by the
Roman Catholics<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> under new names, the defenders of the Latin dogmas
and beliefs answer as follows:—</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lucifer, the jealous neighbour of the Sun (Christ) said to himself in his
great pride: ‘I will rise as high as he!’ He was thwarted in his design
by Mercury, though the brightness of the latter (who is St. Michael) was
as much lost in the blazing fires of the great Solar orb as his own was,
and though, like Lucifer, Mercury is only the assessor, and the guard of
honour to the Sun.”—(<cite>Ibid.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c001'>Guards of “dishonour” now rather, if the teachings of <em>theological</em>
Christianity were true. But here comes in the cloven foot of the Jesuit.
The ardent defender of Roman Catholic Demonolatry and of the worship
of the seven planetary spirits, at the same time, pretends great wonder
at the coincidences between old Pagan and Christian <em>legends</em>, between
the fable about Mercury and Venus, and the <em>historical truths</em> told of
St. Michael—the “angel of the face,”—the terrestrial double, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ferouer</i></span>
of Christ. He points them out saying: “like Mercury, the archangel
Michael, is the <em>friend</em> of the Sun, his Mitra, perhaps, for Michael is a
<em>psychopompic</em> genius, one who leads the separated souls to their appointed
abodes, and like Mitra, he is the <em>well-known adversary of the demons</em>.”
This is demonstrated by the book of the <cite>Nabatheans</cite> recently discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>(by Chwolson), in which the <a id='corr20.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Zoroastian'>Zoroastrian</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_20.1'><ins class='correction' title='Zoroastian'>Zoroastrian</ins></a></span> Mitra is called the “<em>grand enemy
of the planet Venus</em>.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> (<i>ibid</i> p. 160.)</p>

<p class='c001'>There is something in this. A candid confession, for once, of
perfect identity of celestial personages and of <em>borrowing</em> from every pagan
source. It <em>is</em> curious, if unblushing. While in the oldest Mazdean
allegories, Mitra conquers the planet Venus, in Christian tradition
Michael defeats Lucifer, and both receive, as war spoils, the planet of
the vanquished deity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mitra,” says Dollinger, “possessed, in days of old, the star of Mercury,
placed between the sun and the moon, but he was given the planet of
the conquered, and ever since his victory he is identified with Venus.”
(<i>“Judaisme and Paganisme,” Vol. II., p. 109. French transl.</i>)</p>

<p class='c001'>“In the Christian tradition,” adds the learned Marquis, “St. Michael
<em>is apportioned in Heaven the throne and the palace of the foe he has vanquished</em>.
Moreover, like Mercury, during the palmy days of paganism,
which made sacred to this <em>demon</em>-god all the promontories of the
earth, <em>the Archangel is the patron of the same in our religion</em>.” This
means, if it does mean anything, that <em>now</em>, at any rate, Lucifer-Venus is
a <em>sacred</em> planet, and no synonym of Satan, since St. Michael has become
his legal heir?</p>

<p class='c001'>The above remarks conclude with this cool reflection:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is evident that paganism has <em>utilised beforehand</em>, and most marvellously,
all the features and characteristics of the <em>prince of the face of
the Lord</em> (Michael) in applying them to that <em>Mercury</em>, to the Egyptian
<em>Hermes Anubis</em>, and the <em>Hermes Christos</em> of the Gnostics. Each of these
was represented as the first among the divine councillors, and the
god nearest to the sun, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>quis ut Deus</i></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Which title, with all its attributes, became that of Michael. The
good Fathers, the Master Masons of the temple of <em>Church</em> Christianity,
knew indeed how to utilize pagan material for their new dogmas.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact is, that it is sufficient to examine certain Egyptian
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cartouches</i></span>, pointed out by Rossellini (<cite>Egypte</cite>, Vol. I., p. 289), to find
Mercury (the double of Sirius in our solar system) as Sothis, preceded
by the words “<em>sole</em>” and “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>solis custode, sostegnon dei dominanti, e
forte grande dei vigilanti</i></span>,” “watchman of the sun, sustainer of dominions,
and the strongest of all the vigilants.” All these titles and attributes
are now those of the Archangel Michael, who has inherited them from
the <em>demons</em> of paganism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moreover, travellers in Rome may testify to the wonderful presence in
the statue of Mitra, at the Vatican, of the best known Christian symbols.
Mystics boast of it. They find “in his lion’s head, and the eagle’s
wings, those of the courageous Seraph, the master of space (Michael);
in his caduceus, the spear, in the two serpents coiled round the body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the struggle of the good and bad principles, and especially in the two
keys which the said Mitra holds, like St. Peter, the keys with which this
Seraph-patron of the latter opens and shuts the gates of Heaven,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>astra cludit et recludit</i></span>.” (<cite>Mem</cite>: p. 162.)</p>

<p class='c001'>To sum up, the aforesaid shows that the theological romance of
Lucifer was built upon the various myths and allegories of the pagan
world, and that it is no <em>revealed</em> dogma, but simply one invented to
uphold superstition. Mercury being one of the Sun’s <em>assessors</em>, or the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>cynocephali</i></span> of the Egyptians and <em>the watch-dogs of the Sun</em>, literally,
the other was <em>Eosphoros</em>, the most brilliant of the planets, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>qui mane
oriebaris</i></span>,” the early rising, or the Greek ὀρθρινὸς. It was identical
with the <em>Amoon-ra</em>, the light-bearer of Egypt, and called by all
nations “the <em>second born</em> of light” (the first being Mercury), the beginning
of his (the Sun’s) ways of wisdom, the Archangel Michael being
also referred to as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>principium viarum Domini</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus a purely astronomical personification, built upon an occult
meaning which no one has hitherto seemed to unriddle outside the
Eastern wisdom, has now become a dogma, part and parcel of Christian
revelation. A clumsy transference of characters is unequal to the task
of making thinking people accept in one and the same trinitarian
group, the “Word” or Jesus, God and Michael (with the Virgin occasionally
to complete it) on the one hand, and Mitra, Satan and Apollo-Abbadon
on the other: the whole at the whim and pleasure of Roman
Catholic Scholiasts. If Mercury and Venus (Lucifer) are (astronomically
in their revolution around the Sun) the symbols of God the Father, the
Son, and of their Vicar, Michael, the “Dragon-Conqueror,” in Christian
legend, why should they when called Apollo-<em>Abaddon</em>, the “King of
the Abyss,” Lucifer, Satan, or Venus—become forthwith devils and
demons? If we are told that the “conqueror,” or “Mercury-Sun,” or
again St. Michael of the <cite>Revelation</cite>, was given the spoils of the
conquered angel, namely, his planet, why should opprobrium be any
longer attached to a constellation so purified? Lucifer is now the
“Angel of the Face of the Lord,”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> because “that face is mirrored in it.”
We think rather, because the Sun is reflecting his beams in Mercury
seven times more than it does on our Earth, and twice more in Lucifer-Venus:
the Christian symbol proving again its astronomical origin. But
whether from the astronomical, mystical or symbological aspect, Lucifer
is as good as any other planet. To advance as a proof of its demoniacal
character, and identity with Satan, the configuration of Venus, which
gives to the crescent of this planet the appearance of a cut-off horn is
rank nonsense. But to connect this with the horns of “The Mystic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Dragon” in <cite>Revelation</cite>—“one of which was broken”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>—as the two
French Demonologists, the Marquis de Mirville and the Chevalier des
Mousseaux, the champions of the Church militant, would have their
readers believe in the second half of our present century—is simply
an insult to the public.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides which, the Devil had no horns before the fourth century of
the Christian era. It is a purely Patristic invention arising from their
desire to connect the god Pan, and the pagan Fauns and Satyrs, with
their Satanic legend. The demons of Heathendom were as hornless
and as tailless as the Archangel Michael himself in the imaginations of
his worshippers. The “horns” were, in pagan symbolism, an emblem
of divine power and creation, and of fertility in nature. Hence the
ram’s horns of Ammon, of Bacchus, and of Moses on ancient medals,
and the cow’s horns of Isis and Diana, etc., etc., and of the Lord God of
the Prophets of Israel himself. For Habakkuk gives the evidence that
this symbolism was accepted by the “chosen people” as much as by the
Gentiles. In Chapter III. that prophet speaks of the “Holy One from
Mount Paran,” of the Lord God who “comes from Teman, and <em>whose
brightness was as the light</em>,” and who had “<em>horns</em> coming out of his
hand.”</p>

<p class='c001'>When one reads, moreover, the Hebrew text of Isaiah, and finds
that no Lucifer is mentioned at all in Chapter XIV., v. 12, but simply
הֵילֵל, <em>Hillel</em>, “a <em>bright</em> star,” one can hardly refrain from wondering that
<em>educated</em> people should be still ignorant enough at the close of our century
to associate a radiant planet—or anything else in nature for the
matter of that—with the <span class='sc'>Devil</span>!<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

    <div>A LIFETIME.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Overhead the boughs of the trees intermingle, hiding the deep blue
sky and mellowing the fierce heat of the sun. The boughs are so
covered with white blossoms that it is like a canopy of clustered
snow-flakes, tinged here and there with a soft pink. It is a natural orchard,
a spot favoured by the wild apricot. And among the trees, wandering
from shine to shade, flitting to and fro, is a solitary figure. It is that of a
young woman, a savage, one of a wild and fierce tribe dwelling in the
fastnesses of an inaccessible virgin forest. She is dark but beautiful.
Her blue-black hair hangs far down over her naked body; its masses
shield the warm, quivering, nervous brown skin from the direct rays
of the sun. She wears neither clothing nor any ornament. Her eyes
are dark, fierce and tender: her mouth soft and natural as the lips of
an opening flower. She is absolutely perfect in her simple savage
beauty and in the natural majesty of her womanhood, virgin in herself
and virgin in the quality of her race, which is untaught, undegraded.
But in her sublimely natural face is the dawn of a great tragedy. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>soul, her thought, is struggling to awake. She has done a deed that
seemed to her quite simple, quite natural; yet now it is done a dim
perplexity is rising within her obscure mind. Wandering to and fro
beneath the rich masses of blossom-laden boughs, she for the first time
endeavours to question herself. Finding no answer within she goes
again to look on that which she has done.</p>

<p class='c001'>A form lies motionless upon the ground within the thickest shade
of the rich fruit trees. A young man, one of her own tribe, beautiful
like herself, and with strength and vigour written in every line of his
form. But he is dead. He was her lover, and she found his love sweet,
yet with one wild treacherous movement of her strong supple arm she
had killed him. The blood flowed from his forehead where the sharp
stone had made the death wound. The life blood ebbed away from his
strong young form; a moment since his lips still trembled, now they
were still. Why had she in this moment of fierce passion taken that
beautiful life? She loved him as well as her untaught heart knew how
to love; but he, exulting in his greater strength, tried to snatch her
love before it was ripe. It was but a blossom, like the white flowers
overhead: he would have taken it with strong hands as though it were a
fruit ripe and ready. And then in a sudden flame of wondrous new
emotion the woman became aware that the man was her enemy, that
he desired to be her tyrant. Until now she had thought him as herself,
a thing to love as she loved herself, with a blind unthinking trust.
And she acted passionately upon the guidance of this thing—feeling—which
until now she had never known. He, unaccustomed to any
treachery or anger, suspected no strange act from her, and thus, unsuspicious,
unwarned, he was at her mercy. And now he lay dead at
her feet. And still the fierce sun shone through the green leaves and
silvern blossoms and gleamed upon her black hair and tender brown
skin. She was beautiful as the morning when it rose over the tree tops
of that world-old forest. But there is a new wonder in her dark eyes;
a question that was not there until this strange and potent hour came
to her. What ages must pass over her dull spirit ere it can utter the
question; ere it can listen and hear the answer?</p>

<p class='c001'>The savage woman, nameless, unknown save of her tribe, who regard
her as indifferently as any creature of the woods, has none to help her
or stay in its commencement the great roll of the wave of energy she
has started. Blindly she lives out her own emotions. She is dissatisfied,
uneasy, conscious of some error. When she leaves the orchard of wild
fruit trees and wanders back to the clearer part of the forest beneath the
great trees, where her tribe dwells, when she returns among them her lips
are dumb, her voice is silent. None ever heard that he, the one she
loved, had died by her hand, for she knew not how to frame or tell this
story. It was a mystery to her, this thing which had happened. Yet it
made her sad, and her great eyes wore a dumb look of longing. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>she was very beautiful and soon another young and sturdy lover was
always at her side. He did not please her; there was not the glow in
his eyes that had gladdened her in those of the dead one whom she
had loved. And yet she shrunk not from him nor did she raise her arm
in anger, but held it fast at her side lest her passion should break loose
unawares. For she felt that she had brought a want, a despair upon
herself by her former deed; and now she determined that she would act
differently. Blindly she tried to learn the lesson that had come upon her.
Blindly she let herself be the agent of her own will. For now she
became the willing slave and serf of one whom she did not love, and
whose passion for her was full of tyranny. Yet she did not, she dared
not, resist this tyranny; not because she feared him, but because she
feared herself. She had the feeling that one might have who had come
in contact with a new and hitherto unknown natural force. She feared
lest resistance or independence should bring upon her a greater wonder,
a greater sadness and loss than that which she had already brought
upon herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so she submitted to that which in her first youth would no more
have been endured by her than the bit by the wild horse.</p>

<p class='c001'>The apricot blossom has fallen and fruit has followed it; the leaves
have fallen and the trees are bare. The sky is grey and wild above, the
ground dank and soft with fallen leaves below. The aspect of the
place is changed, but it is the same; the face and form of the woman
have changed; but she is the same. She is alone again in the wild
orchard, finding her way by instinct to the spot where her first lover
died. She has found it. What is there? Some white bones that lie
together; a skeleton. The woman’s eyes fasten and feed on the sight
and grow large and terrible. Horror at last is struck into her soul.
This is all that is left of her young love, who died by her hand—white
bones that lie in ghastly order! And the long hot days and sultry
nights of her life have been given to a tyrant who has reaped no gladness
and no satisfaction from her submission; for he has not learned yet
even the difference between woman and woman. All alike are mere
creatures like the wild things; creatures to hunt and to conquer.
Dumbly in her dark heart strange questionings arise. She turns from
this graveyard of her unquestioning time and goes back to her slavery.
Through the years of her life she waits and wonders, looking blankly
at the life around her. Will no answer come to her soul?</p>

    <div>AFTER SLEEP, AWAKENING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Splendid was the veil that shielded her from that other soul, the soul
she knew and of which she showed her recognition by swift and sudden
love. But the veil separated them; a veil heavy with gold and
shining with stars of silver. And as she gazed upon these stars, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>delighted admiration of their brilliance, they grew larger and larger, till
at length they blended together, and the veil became one shining sheen
gorgeous with golden broideries. Then it became easier to see through
the veil, or rather it seemed easier to these lovers. For before the veil
had made the shape appear dim; now it appeared glorious and ideally
beautiful and strong. Then the woman put out her hand, hoping to
obtain the pressure of another hand through the shining gossamer.
And at the same instant he too put out his hand, for in this moment
their souls communicated, and they understood each other. Their
hands touched; the veil was broken; the moment of joy was ended
and again the struggle began.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A LIFETIME.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Sitting, singing, on the steps of an old palace, her feet paddling in
the water of a broad canal, was a child who was becoming more than a
child; a creature on the threshold of life, of awakening sensation.
A girl, with ruddy gold hair, and innocent blue eyes, that had in their
vivid depths the strange startled look of a wild creature. She was as
simple and isolated in her happiness as any animal of the woods or
hills—the sunshine, the sweet air with the faint savour of salt in it, her
own pure clear girlish voice, and the gay songs of the people that she
sang—these were pleasure enough and to spare for her.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the space of unconscious happiness or unhappiness which
heralds the real events of a life was already at an end. The great wave
which she had set in motion was increasing in volume ceaselessly; how
long before it shall reach the shore and break upon that far off coast?
None can know, save those whose eyesight is more than man’s. None
can tell; and she is ignorant, unknowing. But though she knows
nothing of it, she is within the sweep of the wave, and is powerless
to arrest it until her soul shall awake.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My blossom, my beautiful wild flower,” said a voice close beside her.
A young boatman had brought his small vessel so gently to the steps
she had not noticed his approach. He leaned over his boat towards
her, and touched her bare white feet with his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come away with me, Wild Blossom,” he said. “Leave that
wretched home you cling to. What is there to keep you there now
your mother is dead? Your father is like a savage, and makes you live
like a savage too. Come away with me, and we will live among people
who will love you and find you beautiful as I do. Will you come?
How often have I asked you, Wild Blossom, and you have never
answered. Will you answer now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said the girl, looking up with grave, serious eyes, that had
beneath their beauty a melancholy meaning, a sad question.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The man saw this strange look and interpreted it as clearly as he
could.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust me,” he said, “I am not a savage like your father. When you
are my little wife I will care for you far more dearly than myself.
You will be my soul, my guide, my star. And I will shield you as
my soul is shielded within my body, follow you as my guide, look up
to you as to a star in the blue heavens. Surely you can trust my love,
Wild Blossom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He had not answered the doubt in her heart, for he had not guessed
what it was, nor could she have told him. For she had not yet learned
to know what it was, nor to know of it more than that it troubled her.
But she put it aside and silenced it now, for the moment had come to
do so. Not till she had learned her lesson much more fully could the
question ever be expressed even to her own soul, and before this could
be, the question must be silenced many times.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she said, “I will come.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She held out her hand to him as if to seal the compact. He
interpreted the gesture by his own desire, and taking her hand in his
drew her towards him. She yielded and stepped into the boat. And
then he quickly pushed away from the steps, and, dipping his oars in
the water, soon had gone far away down the canal. Blossom looking
earnestly back, watched the old palace disappear. In some of its old
rooms and on its sunny steps her child-life had been spent. Now she
knew that was at an end. She understood that all was changed henceforth,
though she could not guess into what she was going, and she
waited for her future with a strange confidence in the companion she
had accepted. This puzzled her dimly. Yet how should she lack
confidence, having known him long ago and thrown away his love and
his life beneath the wild apricot trees, having seen afterwards the
steadfastness of his love when her soul stood beside his in soul life?</p>

<p class='c001'>A long way they went in the little boat. They left the canals and
went out upon the open sea, and still the boatman rowed unwearyingly,
his eyes all the while upon the beautiful wild blossom he had plucked
and carried away with him to be his own, his dear and adored possession.
Far away along the coast lay a small village of fishermen’s cots.
It was to this that the young man guided his boat, for it was here
he dwelled.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the door of his cot stood his old mother, a quaint old woman
with wrinkled, rosy face, wearing a rough fishwife’s dress and coarse
shawl; her brown hand shaded her eyes as she watched her son’s boat
approaching. Presently a smile came on her mouth. “He’s gotten
the blossom he’s talked of so often in his sleep. Will he be happy
now, the good lad?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was truly a good lad; for his mother knew him well, and the more
she knew him the deeper grew her love. She would do anything for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>his happiness. And now she took to her arms the child, the Blossom,
and cherished her for his sake. Before many days had passed the
fishing village made a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fête</i></span> day for the wedding of its strongest boatman.
And the women’s eyes filled with tears when they looked at the sad,
tender, questioning face of the beautiful Wild Blossom.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had given her love without hesitation, in complete confidence.
She had given more; herself, her life, her very soul. The surrender
was now complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now, when all seemed done and all accomplished, her question
began to be answered. Dimly she knew that, spite of the husband
at whose feet she bowed, spite of the babes she carried in her arms
till their tiny feet were strong enough to carry them down over the
shore to the marge of the blue waters, spite of the cottage home she
garnished and cleansed and loved so dearly, spite of all, her heart was
hungry and empty. What could it mean, that though she had all she
had none? Blossom was grown a woman now, and there were some
lines of care and of pain on her forehead. Yet, still, she was beautiful
and still she bore her child-name of Blossom; but the beauty of her
face grew sadder and more strange as the years went by, the years
that bring ease and satisfaction to the stagnant soul. Wild Blossom’s
soul was eager and anxious; she could not still the mysterious voices of
her heart, and these told her (though perhaps she did not always understand
their speech) that her husband was not in reality her king; that
he heard no sound from that inner region in which she chiefly existed.
For him contentment existed in the outward life that he lived, in sheer
physical pleasure, in the excitement of hard work, and the dangers of
the sea, in the beauty of his wife, the mirth of his happy children. He
asked no more. But Wild Blossom’s eyes had the prophetic light
in them. She saw that all this peace must pass, this pleasure end; she
recognised that these things did not, could not, absolutely satisfy the
spirit; her soul seemed to tremble within her as she began to feel
the first dawn of the terrible answer to her sad questioning.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Many a long year later, a solitary woman dwelled in that fisherman’s
cottage on the shore of the blue sea. She was old and bowed with
age and trouble. But still her eyes were brighter than any girl’s in the
village, and held in them the mysterious beauty of the soul; still her
hair, once golden, now grey, waved about her forehead. The people
loved her and were kind to her, for she was always gentle and full of
generous thought. But they never understood her, for they were long
ages behind her in her growth. She was ready now for the great central
test of personal existence; the experience of life in civilization. When
the old fishwife lay dead within her cottage, and the people came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>grieve beside her body, they little guessed that she was going on to a
great and glorious future; a future full of daring and of danger. When
her eyes closed in death, her inner eyes opened on a sight that filled
her with absolute joy. She was in a garden of fruit trees, and the
blossom of the trees was at its full. When her eyes fell on this white
maze of flowers and drank in its beauty, she remembered the name she
had borne on earth and dimly understood its meaning. The blossoms
hid from her the sky and all else until a soft pressure on her hand drew
her eyes downwards; and then she saw beside her that one whom she
had loved through the ages, and who, side by side with her, was experiencing
the profound mystery, and learning the strange lesson of
incarnation in the world where sex is the first great teacher. And with
each phase of existence that they passed through, these two forged
stronger and stronger links that held them together and compelled
them again and again to meet, so that together they were destined to
pass through the vital hour; the hour when the life is shaped for greater
ends or for vain deeds.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here within this sheltered place, where blossoms filled the air with
sweetness and beauty, it seemed to them, that they had attained to
the full of pleasure. They rested in perfect satisfaction, drinking deep
draughts of the joy of living. To them existence seemed a final and
splendid fact in itself; existence as they then had it. The moment in
which they lived was sufficient, they desired none other, nor any other
place, nor any other beauty, than those they had. None knows and none
can tell what time or age was passed in this deep contentment and
fulfilment of pleasure. At last Wild Blossom’s soul woke from its
sleep, satiated; the hunger returned to gnaw at her heart; the longing
to know reasserted itself. Holding tight the hand she held in hers,
she sprang from the soft couch on which she lay. Then, for the first
time, she noticed that the ground was so soft and pleasant, because there,
where she had lain, had drifted great heaps of the fallen fruit blossoms.
The ground was all white with them, though some had begun to lose
their delicate beauty, to curl and wrinkle and turn dark. Then she
looked overhead and saw that the trees had, with the loss of the delicate
petals, lost their first fairness, the splendour of the spring. Now they
were covered with small, hard, green fruit, scarce formed, unbeautiful to
the eye, hard to the touch, acid to the taste. With a shudder of regret
for the sweet spring time that was gone, Wild Blossom hurried away
from the trees, still holding fast that other hand in hers. She was going
to face new, strange experiences, perhaps terrible dangers: her task was
the easier for that tried companionship, for the nearness of that other
who was climbing the same steep ladder of life.</p>

    <div>END OF INTRODUCTION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER I.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In a masked ball there is an element of adventure that appeals to
the daring of both sexes, to the bright and witty spirits. Hilary
Estanol was just such an one as the hero of a bright revel should
be. A beautiful boy, with a lovely face, and eyes that had in them a
deep sadness. In repose his face was almost womanish in its softness;
but a chill brilliance was in his smile, a certain slight cynicism coloured
all his speech. Yet Hilary had no reason to be a cynic, and he was not
one who adopted anything from fashion or affectation. The spring of
this uncalled-for coldness and indifference lay in himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>To-night he was the centre of attraction in Madame Estanol’s drawing-rooms.
This <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bal masqué</i></span> was to celebrate his coming of age, and Hilary
had never looked so womanish as when he stood among his friends
receiving their congratulations and admiring their gifts. He wore the
dress of a troubadour, and it was one which became him well, not only
in its picturesqueness as a costume, but in the requirements of the
character. He had the faculty of the improvisatore, his voice was rich
and soft, his musical and poetic gifts swift and versatile. Hilary was
adored by his friends, but disliked, indeed almost hated, by his one near
relation, his mother. She was standing near him now, talking to a group
who had gathered round her. She was one of the cleverest women of
the day, and, still beautiful and full of a charming pride, held a court
of her own. Her dislike for Hilary was founded on her estimate of his
character. To one of her intimate friends she had said, not long before
this night, “Hilary will disgrace his name and family before there is one
grey thread in his dark hair. He has the qualities that bring despair and
ensure remorse. God will surely forgive me that I say this of my son;
but I see it before me, an abyss into which he will drag me with him;
and I wait for it every day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A guest, just arrived, approached Madame Estanol with a smile, and
after greeting her affectionately, said, in a whisper, “I have brought a
friend with me. Welcome her in her character as a fortune-teller. She
is very witty, and will amuse us presently, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She moved aside a little, and Madame Estanol saw standing behind
her a stooping figure, an old haggard crone, with palsied head, and hand
that trembled as it grasped her stick.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, Countess! it is impossible to recognise your friend under this
disguise,” said Madame Estanol. “Will you not tell me who she is?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am pledged to say nothing but that she is a fortune-teller,” said the
Countess Bairoun. “Her name she herself will reveal only to one person;
and that person must be born under the star that favoured her own birth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The fortune-teller turned her bent head towards Madame Estanol, and
fixed a pair of brilliant and fascinating eyes on hers. Immediately
Madame Estanol became aware of a strong charm that drew her towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>this mysterious person. She advanced and held out her hand to assist
the old woman in moving across the room.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come with me,” she said, “I should like to introduce you to my son.
He is the hero of this scene to-night, for the ball is held in honour of his
coming of age.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They went together through the maskers that were now beginning to
throng the large drawing-rooms, and everyone turned to look at the
strange figure of the tottering old crone. Hilary Estanol was leaning
against the high carved oak mantel frame of the inner drawing-room,
surrounded by a laughing group of his intimate friends. He held his
mask in his hand, and as he stood there smiling, his dark curls falling
on his forehead, his mother thought, as she approached him, “My boy
grows handsomer every hour of his gay young life.” When Hilary saw
his mother’s strange companion he advanced a step, as if to welcome her,
but Madame Estanol checked him with a smile. “I cannot introduce
our visitor to you,” she said, “for I do not know her name. She will tell
it to but one person, who must have been born under the same star as herself.
Meantime, we are to greet her in her character as the fortune-teller.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This announcement was welcomed by a murmur of amusement and
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then will our kind visitor perhaps exercise her craft for us?” asked
Hilary, gazing with curiosity at the trembling head and grey locks before
him. The old woman turned her head sideways, and gave him a look
from those strange brilliant eyes. He, too, like his mother, felt the charm
from them. But he felt more. Something suddenly wakened within him;
a rush of inexplicable emotions roused him into amazement; he put his
hand to his forehead; he was bewildered, almost faint.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a small drawing-room which opened out of the room they
were in. It was so tiny that it held but a table covered with flowers, a
low couch and an easy-chair. The laughing group that surrounded
Hilary went eagerly to convert this room into the sanctum of the prophetess.
They lowered and softened the shaded light; drew close the
blinds and shut the doors, locking all but one. Here was placed a
guardian who was to admit grudgingly and one by one those who were
fortunate enough to speak alone with the sybil, for she would only see
certain of the guests whom she selected herself from the throng, describing
their appearance and dress to the guardian of her improvised
temple. These were all ladies of great position. They entered laughing
and half defiant. They came out, some pale, some red, some trembling,
some in tears. “Who can she be?” they whispered in terrified tones
to one another, and in that terror showed how she had penetrated their
hearts and touched on their secret thoughts.</p>

<p class='c001'>At last the guardian of the door said that Hilary himself was to
enter.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Hilary went in, the young man, as he closed the door on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>fortune teller and her new guest, turned with a laugh to the group
behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Already she has startled him,” he said, “I heard him utter almost
a cry as he entered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Could you see in?” asked one, “perhaps she has taken off her
disguise for her host!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I saw nothing,” he answered. “Can none of you who have been
in guess who she is?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” answered a girl who had come out from the ordeal with white
and trembling lips. “It is impossible to guess. She knows everything.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was as they had supposed. She had taken off her disguise for her
host. The staff, the large cloak, the wig and cap lay on the ground.
With the swift use of a cosmetiqued kerchief she had removed from
her fair skin the dark complexion of the ancient sybil. When Hilary
entered she had completed this rapid toilette and sat leaning back in a
low chair. She was dressed in a rich evening costume; she held a
mask in her hand ready for use. But now her face was uncovered; her
strange and brilliant eyes were fixed on Hilary; her beautiful mouth
wore a half smile of amusement at his surprise. It was more than
surprise that he experienced. Again that rush of inexplicable emotion
overpowered him. He felt like one intoxicated. He regarded her very
earnestly for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely,” he said, “we have met before!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We were born under the same star,” she answered in a voice that
thrilled him. Until now he had not heard her speak. The sense of
some strong link or association that united them, was made doubly
strong by the sound of that voice, rich, strong and soft. Suddenly he
recognised the meaning of his emotion. He no longer struggled
against it, he no longer was bewildered by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He approached her and sat down upon the couch at her side. He
regarded her with wonder and adoration, but no longer with awe or
surprise. For he understood that the event which he had imagined
would never come was already here—he was in love.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You said you would disclose your name to the one who was born
under the same star as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not know me?” she said with a slight look of surprise. She
fancied everyone knew her at least by sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not,” he answered, “though indeed I am perplexed to think I
can ever have lived without knowing you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Flattery produced no effect upon her, she lived in an atmosphere
of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am the Princess Fleta,” she answered. Hilary started and
coloured a little at the words, and could ill control his emotion. The
Princess Fleta held a position in the society of the country, which can
only belong to one who stands next to a throne that rules an important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>nation. She was a personage among crowned heads, one to whom an
emperor might, without stooping, offer his love; and Hilary, the child of
an officer of the Austrian army, and of a poor daughter of a decayed
aristocratic family, Hilary had in the swift stirring of love at first
sight, told his own heart that he loved her! It could never be unsaid,
and he knew it. He had whispered the words within himself, the
whisper would find a hundred echoes. He must always love her.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Princess turned her wonderful eyes on him and smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have done my work for to-night,” she said. “I have amused some
of the people, now I should like to dance.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary was sufficient of a courtier not to be deaf to this command,
though his whole soul was in his eyes and all his thoughts fixed on her
beauty. He rose and offered her his arm, she put on her mask and
they left the room. When Hilary appeared among the crowd that
hung round the door of the fortune teller’s sanctum, accompanied by a
slender, graceful woman, whose face was hidden save for the great dark
eyes, there was an irrepressible murmur of excitement and wonder.
“Who can she be?” was repeated again a hundred times. But no one
guessed. None dreamed this could be the Princess Fleta herself; for
there were but few houses she would visit at, and no one imagined that
there could be any inducement to bring her to Madame Estanol’s. The
mystery of her presence she explained to Hilary while they danced
together.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am a student of magic,” she said, “and I have already learned some
useful secrets. I can read the hearts of the courtiers who surround me,
and I know where to look for true friends. Last night I dreamed of the
friend I should find here. Do you care for these mystic occupations?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know nothing of them,” said Hilary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let me teach you then,” said the Princess, with a light laugh.
“You will be a good pupil, that I know. Perhaps I may make a disciple
of you! and there are not many with whom that is possible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why?” asked Hilary. “Surely it is a fascinating study to
those who can believe in the secrets.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Scepticism is not the great difficulty,” answered the Princess, “but
fear. Terror turns the crowd back from the threshold. Only a few dare
cross it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And you are one of the few,” said Hilary, gazing on her with eyes
of burning admiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have never felt fear,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And would it be impossible to make you feel it, I wonder,” said
Hilary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you desire to try?” she answered, with a smile at his daring
speech. It did not sound so full of impertinence as it looks, for Hilary’s
eyes and face were all alight with love and admiration, and his voice
trembled with passion.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“You can make the attempt if you choose,” she said, glancing at him
with those strange eyes of hers. “Terrify me if you can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not here, in my own house, it would not be hospitable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come and see me, then, some day when you think it will amuse you.
Try and frighten me. I will show you my laboratory, where I produce
essences and incenses to please the gnomes and ghouls.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary accepted this invitation with a flush of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take me to the Countess,” she said at last. “I am going home. But
I want her first to introduce me to your mother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Countess was delighted that the Princess had made up her mind
to this. She hardly thought Madame Estanol would be pleased to
discover that the great lady had been masquerading in her drawing-room,
and had not cared to throw off her disguise even for her hostess.
And the Countess valued the friendship of Madame Estanol; so she was
glad the wilful Princess had decided to treat her with politeness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Madame Estanol could scarcely conceal her surprise at learning what
the dignity was which had been hidden under the disguise of the old
fortune-teller. The Princess did not remove her mask, and, with a laugh,
she warned Madame Estanol that some of her guests would not be
pleased to discover who the sybil was who had read their hearts so
shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c001'>When she had gone, Hilary’s heart and spirits had gone with her. It
seemed as if he hardly cared to speak; his laughter had died away
altogether. His thoughts, his very self, followed the fascinating
personality that had bewitched him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Madame Estanol saw his abstraction, his flushed eager look, and the
new softness of his eyes. But she said no word. She feared the
Princess, who was well known to be full of caprice and wilfulness. She
feared lest Hilary should be mad enough to yield to the charm of the
girl’s beauty and confident manner; the charm of power, peculiar,
or rather, possible only to one in a royal place. But she would say
no word; knowing Hilary well, she knew that any attempt to influence
him against it would only intensify his new passion.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<p class='c015'>Two days later Hilary nerved himself to pay the visit to the Princess.
He thought she could not consider it to be too soon, for it seemed to him
two months since he had seen her.</p>

<p class='c001'>She lived in a garden-house some two or three miles away in the
country. Her father’s palace in the city never pleased her; she only
came there when festivities or ceremonials made her presence necessary.
In the country, with her chaperone and her maids, she was free to do
as she chose. For they were one and all afraid of her, and held her
“laboratory” in the profoundest respect. None of them would have
entered that room except to avoid some dreadful doom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary was taken to the Princess in the garden, where she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>walking to and fro in an avenue of trees which were covered with sweet
scented blossoms. She welcomed Hilary with a charming manner, and
the hour he spent with her here in the sunshine was one of the wildest
intoxication. They began openly to play the pretty game of love.
Now that no eyes were on them the Princess let him forget that she
belonged to a different rank from his own. When she was tired of
walking, “Come,” she said, “and I will shew you my laboratory. No one
in this house ever enters it. If you should say in the city that you
have been in that room you will be besieged with questions. Be careful
to say nothing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would die sooner,” exclaimed Hilary, to whom the idea of talking
about the Princess and her secrets seemed like sacrilege.</p>

<p class='c001'>The room was without windows, perfectly dark but for a softened light
shed by a lamp in the centre of the high ceiling. The walls were
painted black and on them were drawn strange figures and shapes in
red. These had evidently not been painted by any artisan hand;
though bold in touch, they were irregular in workmanship. Beside a
great vessel which stood upon the ground, was a chair, and in this chair
a figure upon which Hilary’s attention immediately became fastened.</p>

<p class='c001'>He saw at once that it was not human, that it was not a lay figure,
that it was not a statue. It resembled most a lay figure, but there
was something strange about it which does not exist in the mere form
on which draperies are hung. And its detail was elaborated; the skin
was tinted, the eyes darkened correctly, the hair appeared to be human.
Hilary remained at the doorway unable to advance because of the
fascination this form exercised upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Princess looked back from where she stood in the centre of the
room beneath the light; she saw the direction of his gaze and laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You need not fear it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it a lay figure?” asked Hilary, trying to speak easily, for he
remembered that she despised those who knew fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she answered, “it is my lay figure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was something that puzzled Hilary in her tone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are you an artist?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she answered, “in life—in human nature. I do not work with
a pencil or a brush; I use an agent that cannot be seen yet can be felt.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do you mean?” asked Hilary.</p>

<p class='c001'>She turned on him a strange look, that was at first distrustful, and then
grew soft and tender.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not tell you yet,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary roused himself to answer her lightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have I to pass through some ordeal before you tell me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she answered gaily, “and already an ordeal faces you. Dare
you advance into the room or no?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary made a great effort to break the spell that was on him. He
went hastily across the room to where she stood. Then he realised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that he had actually passed through an ordeal. He had resisted some
force, the nature of which he knew not, and he had come out the victor.
Realising this brought to him another conviction.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Princess,” he said, “there is some one else in this room besides you
and me. We are not alone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He spoke so suddenly, and from so great a sense of startled surprise,
that he did not pause to think whether his question were a wise
one or not. The Princess laughed as she looked at him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are very sensitive,” she said. “Certainly we were born under
the same star, for we are susceptible to the same influences. No, we
are not alone. I have servants here whom no eyes have seen but
mine. Would you like to see them? Do not say yes hastily. It
means a long and tedious apprenticeship, obtaining mastery over these
servants. But unless you conquer them you cannot often see me; for
if you are much near to me they will hate you, and their hate is
greater than your power to resist it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She spoke seriously now, and Hilary felt a strange sensation as he
looked at this beautiful girl standing beneath the lamp light. He
experienced a sudden dread of her as of someone stronger than himself;
and also an impassioned desire to serve her, to be her slave, to give
his life to her utterly. Perhaps she read the love in his eyes, for she
turned away and moved towards the figure in the chair.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know this distresses you,” she said. “You shall see it no longer.”
She opened a large screen which was formed of some gold coloured
material covered with shapes outlined in black. She arranged this so
that the figure was altogether hidden from view and also the great
vessel which stood beside it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now,” she said, “you will breathe more freely. And I am going
to shew you something. We did not come out of the sunshine for no
purpose. And we must be quick, for my good aunt will be terrified
when she finds I have brought you in here. I believe she will hardly
expect to see you alive again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She opened a gold vessel, which stood upon a cabinet, while she spoke,
and the air immediately became full of a strong sweet perfume. Hilary
put his hand to his forehead. Was it possible that he could be so
immediately affected, or was it his imagination that the red shapes and
figures which were on the black wall moved and ordered and arranged
themselves? Yet, so it was; to his eyes the forms mingled and again
broke up and re-mingled. A word was formed and then another. It
was unconsciously imprinted on Hilary’s memory before it changed and
vanished; he noticed only the mysterious occurrence which was happening
before his eyes. Suddenly he became aware that a sentence had
been completed; that words had been written there which he would
never have dared to utter; that on the wall before him had appeared in
letters as of fire the secret of his heart. He staggered back and drew
his eyes with difficulty from the wall to fix them in amazement and fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>upon the Princess. Her face was flushed, her eyes were bright and
tender.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did you see it?” he asked in a trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a moment she hesitated then she answered, “Yes, I saw it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a brief silence. Hilary looked again at the wall, expecting
to see the thought in his mind written there. But the shapes
were returning to their original appearance, and the perfume was dying
out of the air.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come,” said the Princess suddenly, “we have been here long enough.
My aunt will be distressed. Let us go to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She led the way from the room, and Hilary followed her. In another
moment they were in a large drawing-room, flooded with sunshine and
fragrant with flowers; the Princess’ aunt was busied with silks which she
had entangled while at her embroidery; the Princess was on her knees
beside her, holding a skein of yellow silk upon her hands. Hilary
stood a moment utterly bewildered. Had he been dreaming? Was
that black room and its terrible atmosphere a phantasy?</p>

<p class='c001'>He had stayed long enough, and he now took his leave reluctantly.
The Princess, who would have no ceremony at the Garden House, rose
from her knees and said she would open the gate for him. Hilary
flushed with pleasure at this mark of kindness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gate she took him to was a narrow one that stood in a thick-set
hedge of flowering shrubs. When he had passed through he looked
back, and saw the Princess leaning on the gate, framed in gorgeous
blossoms. She smiled and held out her hand to him. The richness of
her presence intoxicated him, and he lost all sense of the apparently
impassable gulf between them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You read the words,” he said, “and you give me your hand in
mine?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I read the words,” she answered, in a soft voice that thrilled him,
“and I give you my hand in yours. Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She had touched his hand for an instant, and now she was gone.
Hilary turned to walk through the flowering hedges to the city. But
his heart, his thought, his soul remained behind. She had read the
words, and she was not angry. She knew of his love for her and she was
not angry. She had read his heart and had not taken offence. What
might he not hope for?</p>

<p class='c001'>Then came another thought. She had read the words. Then that
black room was no phantasy, but a fact as actual as the sunshine. What
were the powers of this strange creature that he loved? He knew
not; but he knew that he loved her.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>An overpowering desire carried him daily on that road between the
flowery hedges to the Garden House. Only sometimes had he the
courage to enter. Most often he lingered at that narrow gate, embosomed
in flowers and looked longingly over it. The first time that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>he entered after this visit, in which his secret was written before his
eyes, he found the Princess standing within the gate. She held out
her hand to him saying simply, “I knew you were coming. I have
prepared something, and I have <a id='corr38.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='presuaded'>persuaded</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.4'><ins class='correction' title='presuaded'>persuaded</ins></a></span> my aunt that no terrible
thing will happen if you are in my laboratory for a little while. So
come with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was brilliantly lit, this black walled room she called her laboratory.
The great vessel stood in the midst of the floor beneath the lamp, and
from it rose flame and smoke. A strong and vivid perfume filled the
air, and the upper part of the high room was clouded with grey blue
smoke, that shone in the light like silver.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the chair beside it sat a figure: it was that of a beautiful woman.
A strange mixture of emotions overpowered Hilary. At the first glance
he felt that this figure was the same he had seen the other day; at the
second he recognised his mother. He rushed forward to her and became
aware that she was lifeless; then he turned passionately upon the
Princess with anger and horror in his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What have you done? What have you done?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nothing,” she said, with a smile. “I have done no harm. Do
you not see that is only an image? My lay figure, as I told you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He gave a long look at the inanimate shape that was so perfect a
representation of his mother, and then he turned upon the Princess a
look of more intense horror than before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are you doing?” he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No harm!” she answered lightly. “Your mother hates and fears
me. I cannot endure that. I am making her love me. I am making
her desire your presence here with me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For a while they stood in silence by the side of the vessel and its
flaming contents; then suddenly Hilary cried out: “I cannot bear it!
Put an end to this terrible spell!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said the Princess, “I will, but not to its results.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She drew the screen before the seated figure, and threw something
into the vessel that instantly quenched the flame.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she led Hilary from the room, and they walked up and down
beneath the trees, talking of things as lovers talk—things that interested
themselves but none other.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Hilary returned home his mother rose from her couch and
held out her hand to him. She drew him to sit beside her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hilary,” she said, “something tells me you have been with the
Princess Fleta. It is well, and I am glad. She is a good friend for
you; ask her if I shall come to see her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hilary rose without replying. The dew stood on his brow. For the
first time he was conscious of actual fear, and the fear he felt was of the
woman he loved.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>A LAW OF LIFE: KARMA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c025'>There is nothing more common to those who know anything
about Theosophy than to be asked:—What is Karma? Karma
is a Sanskrit word which has to be used by those who discuss the
idea it conveys, simply because there is no English word to correspond
to it. That is very easy to answer. Then comes the question:—What
is the idea which it conveys? Than this there is nothing more difficult
to answer, and the reason why this is the case is not far to seek. Let it
once be granted that the constitution of man is complex and complicated,
and that the soul has existed for ages that seem like an eternity, and
existed, moreover, in a garb of flesh which has been changed thousands
of times in the course of those ages. Let this be granted, and, in addition,
that no action is without its effect in the physical, moral, and
spiritual worlds, then, it will be seen, that the answer to the question:
“What is Karma,” is very difficult, if not well-nigh impossible. Still,
some endeavour may be made to give a general idea, though the details
of any individual case can hardly be calculated.</p>

<p class='c001'>Granting the principle of reincarnation, Karma is the <em>working</em>
of the great law which governs those incarnations; but, taken in its
wider sense, Karma may be defined as a manifestation of the One,
Universal, Divine Principle in the phenomenal world. Thus, it may be
further defined as “the great law of Harmony” which governs the
Universe.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it may be replied that Harmony is not the great law of Nature,
but, on the contrary, lack of harmony and discord. And what proof is
there that Harmony is the law?</p>

<p class='c001'>When such proof is required, the answer is at once made:—Too short
a view of life and the universe has been taken. The man who denies the
existence of harmony in the universe has transgressed the law and is
experiencing the punishment. He does this unconsciously to himself,
because the law of harmony forms an unconscious impulse to its re-adjustment
when it has been broken. No better illustration can be given
than in the definition of a fugue, which is:—“A musical composition
in contrapuntal style, in which a subject is proposed by one part, and
then responded to by the others according to certain rules.” Again, in
musical chords, the composing notes, if taken by twos and threes, will be
found in discord, but, when taken altogether, produce a harmony.
Harmony is then the just adaptation of things to each other, and the
universe, the personal element of man being eliminated, is essentially an
evidence of harmony; otherwise it could not exist, for it would fall to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>pieces and no longer be a universe. To those who find only discord
around them, the note to Rule 5, in the second part of “Light on the
Path,” may convey a meaning. No other words can express it better.
One reason for the apparent disharmony may be given. The desires of
man are, as a rule, devoted to the gain of what may be called his personality.
While such is the case in any man, to the exclusion of other
interests, that man cannot dive deep into his own heart and perceive the
real underlying harmony. He is incapable of understanding or even of
perceiving it, because his attention is solely devoted to that which produces
discord. Naturally, then, to him all things seem out of joint, the
reign of discord is ever present, and he cries out perpetually against the
injustice of the world he lives in. But if he will but turn his attention
from his personality to the greater span of his life, and endeavour first
to see evidence of harmony in those around him and then in himself, he
will find that harmony; and his way will be made plain to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Granting, then, that it is the Great Law of Harmony or Karma which
governs the Universe, and which is the Divine principle under one
aspect manifested in Nature, then it is easy to understand that any
action in violation of Nature’s laws will produce a deviation from the
straight line of harmony; consequently the law of harmony will produce
an adjusting effect. Now, who is to produce that effect? Nature, or the
man who committed the action? Both, or rather, the latter under the
influence of the former. The latter most certainly, unless man is to
be regarded simply as a blind puppet. It is possible to compare the
situation to that of a man whose progress is contingent upon an exact
balance being preserved on a pair of scales in front of him. If his
actions disturb the balance of those scales and add weight to one side
or the other, it is necessary immediately to add a counter-balancing
weight on the opposite side and so restore the balance or harmony. (Of
course this is a physical illustration, and can hardly be carried very
far on the moral plane.) That is to say that the one Divine principle is
divided by man’s actions into two opposing forces of good and evil, and
man’s progress depends on the exertion of his will to preserve harmony
and prevent deviation to one side or the other. Evil only exists in contradistinction
to good, and the preservation of such harmony as we have
and the advance towards Universal Harmony—the abstract divinity—is
what all right-minded persons theoretically aspire to.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been thought that, in consequence of the attention paid to
the classics in education, the word Nemesis would replace Karma with
advantage. So perhaps it might have done, had the earliest traditions of
Greek mythology been preserved. But the fatal tendency towards
anthropomorphism set in very strongly even in the palmy days of
Greece, and in consequence Nemesis only pourtrayed the personification
of a human passion. Originally the balancing power, independent of
Zeus and all the Olympian gods, who carried out her decrees, Nemesis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>became simply the avenging deity; so much was this the case that in a
general sense she might have been called the tutelary deity of those
envious of their neighbour’s happiness. Between these points Nemesis
appears as the personification of the moral reverence for law, of the
natural fear of committing a wrong action, and hence the personification
of conscience. It was after this period that Nemesis was said to direct
human affairs, with a view to restore the balance between happiness and
unhappiness. But, in earlier times, the idea of Nemesis was divided into
those of <em>Nemesis</em> and <em>Adrasteia</em> (or what Orientalists would call good
and evil Karma), for even then the idea of evil was beginning to be
attached to Nemesis.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Nemesis was closely linked to both the <em>Moirae</em> (Fates) and the
<em>Eumenides</em> (Furies), who were all the children of Zeus and Night. The
<em>Moirae</em> appear generally as divinities of fate in a strict sense, and act
independently at the helm of necessity. They direct fate, and watch
that the fate assigned to every being <em>by eternal laws</em> shall take its
course (<cite>Aesch</cite>: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Prometheus Vinctus</i></span>, 511-515). Zeus, as well as gods and
men, submits to them. They assign their proper functions to the
Erinnyes who inflict the punishment, and are sometimes called their
sisters (<cite>Aesch</cite>: <cite>Eumen</cite>: 335, 962; <cite>Prometheus</cite> 516, 696, 895). These
latter were always considered to be more ancient than the Olympian
gods, and were therefore not under the rule of Zeus, though they honoured
and esteemed him. The crimes which they especially punished were
(1), violation of the respect due to old age; (2), perjury; (3), murder;
(4), violation of the law of hospitality; (5), improper conduct towards
suppliants; and the punishment was inflicted not only after death but
during life. (It is somewhat curious that these “crimes” are also those
actions which entail the heaviest Karma.) No prayers, sacrifices, or
tears could move them or protect the object of their persecution. When
they feared that he would escape, they called in <em>Dikè</em> to their assistance,
with whom they were closely connected, as justice was said to be their
only object.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now when the meaning of all these “minor” Greek deities is considered,
and further, if it is considered in connection with the definition
of Karma, it will be seen that all are so many personifications of the
main divisions of the law of ancient Nemesis or Karma. But the
one word cannot, in popular estimation, replace the other; for, as said
above, Nemesis has lost its original meaning, and is almost invariably
associated with the idea of vengeance. Karma, however, has never
lost its essential connection with the law of Harmony, though even in
this case there is some tendency to confine it to the law of cause
and effects, and to consider what is called evil Karma solely in
relation to human life. This is almost inevitable, while the human
personality takes the foremost place in the consideration of each
man, and his own welfare, in time and eternity, is the goal of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>endeavours. As said above, while this is the case man cannot regard
the great laws of the Universe, nor recognise himself as part of it, and
thus his life is confined to the world of effects, and can never enter that
of causes. Thus it is ignorance of the law of Harmony that leads
him to struggle in vain, in this world, for the apparent advantage of
surpassing his neighbour, and—worse—to instinctively carry the struggle
beyond death, and attempt to advance in favour in the so-called heavenly
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the result of the pernicious doctrine of reward and punishment
after death, in heaven or in hell. Nothing could have been found more
calculated to circumscribe the view of life as a whole, and concentrate
man’s attention on temporary matters. It is inevitable that man should
regard his soul as something fashioned after his struggling personality,
and very similar to it; and this view of his personality was not calculated
to agree with the loftiness of the ideas about the soul. From this
point of view he either rejected the idea of soul as altogether worthless,
or else he transferred his interest to the soul’s welfare in Heaven—in
either case concentrating his attention on what is inevitably transient.
It is as though a man lost sight of the fact of respiration in its component
parts of inspiration and expiration; that is to say, that one
respiration is taken as the whole, and the millions of other respirations
in the course of a human life are lost sight of and forgotten. Thus the
man who adapts his life to the ordinary views, with regard to life
on earth and life in Heaven, fixes his thoughts and aspirations on
what is transient, and desires to intensify that. No truer words
were ever spoken than by Christ when he said:—“What shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul.” It is a loss
which man will inevitably experience if he pursues this purblind course
of endeavour, for he will lose sight of his <em>real</em> soul altogether, and he—as
<em>he</em>, that is—will never regain it. He follows a flickering Will-o’-the-Wisp,
and finds his way only into a treacherous marsh; the result being
that the whole of that incarnation is wasted, and a stumbling block,
perhaps, placed in the way of the next. This danger is, as said, due
to neglect or ignorance of the idea of Karma, and to the purblind
view consequently taken of the great scope of human life.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the <cite>Theosophist</cite>, of July, 1887, Mr. Subba Row deals with the
doctrine of Karma as contained in the Bhagavadgita. His lecture contains
one of the clearest elucidations of the metaphysical side of the
question which it is possible to put in language, so far as the Kosmic
aspect of Karma is concerned. In it, and the previous lectures, Mr.
Subba Row dealt with three main bases or vehicles<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> (states of matter)
through which the light of the spirit is reflected into the phenomenal
world. These vehicles, when traced to their origin, lead to <em>prakriti</em>, or
matter; as opposed to <em>purusha</em>, or spirit.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“So Krishna says that all Karma is traceable to Upadhi, and hence to <em>Prakriti</em>.
<em>Karma</em> itself depends upon conscious existence. Conscious existence entirely depends
upon the constitution of man’s mind.... <em>Upadhi</em> is the cause of individual
existence. Existence itself, I mean living existence, is, however, traceable to this light
(of the Logos). All conscious existence is traceable to it, and, furthermore, when
spiritual intelligence is developed, it directly springs from it.... Now it is through
the action of this <em>Karma</em> that individual existence makes its appearance. On account
of this <em>Karmae</em> individual existence is maintained, and it is on account of <em>Karma</em> that
man suffers all the pains and sorrows of earthly existence. Birth, life, and death, and
all the innumerable ills to which human nature is subject, are endured by mankind
owing to this <em>Karma</em>.... Thus <em>Karma</em>, being the inevitable result of <em>Prakriti</em>,
and <em>Prakriti</em> continuing to exist as long as you are a human being, it is useless to try
to get rid of <em>Karma</em>.... When you renounce this desire (desire to do Karma
other than from a sense of duty), <em>Karma</em> will become weaker and weaker in its ability
to affect you, till at last you arrive at a condition in which you are not affected by
<em>Karma</em> at all, and that condition is the condition of <em>Mukti</em>.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Those philosophers who want to reject all <em>Karma</em> pretend to renounce it altogether.
But that is an impossible task. No man, so long as he is a human being, can ever
give up <em>Karma</em> altogether. He is at least bound to do that which the bare existence
of his physical body requires, unless, indeed, he means to die of starvation, or otherwise
put an untimely end to his life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Supposing you do give up <em>Karma</em>—that is abstain from it in action, how can you
keep control over your own minds? It is useless to abstain from an act, and yet be
constantly thinking of it. If you come to the resolution that you ought to give up
<em>Karma</em>, you must necessarily conclude that you ought not even to think about these
things. That being so, let us see in what a condition you will then place yourselves.
As almost all our mental states have some connection with the phenomenal world, and
are somehow or other connected with <em>Karma</em> in its various phases, it is difficult to
understand how it is possible for a man to give up all <em>Karma</em>, unless he can annihilate
his mind, or get into an eternal state of <em>Sushupti</em> (<em>dreamless</em> slumber). Moreover, if
you have to give up all <em>Karma</em>, you have to give up good <em>Karma</em> as well as bad, for
<em>Karma</em>, in its widest sense, is not confined to bad actions. If all the people in the
world give up <em>Karma</em>, how is the world to exist? Is it not likely that an end will
then be put to all good impulses, to all patriotic and philanthropic deeds, that all
the good people, who have been and are exerting themselves in doing unselfish
deeds for the good of their fellow men, will be prevented from working? If you
call upon everybody to give up <em>Karma</em>, you will simply create a number of lazy
drones, and prevent good people from benefiting their fellow beings.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And furthermore, it may be argued that this is not a rule of universal applicability.
How few are there in the world who can give up their whole <em>Karma</em>,
and reduce themselves to a condition of eternal inactivity. And if you ask these
people to follow this course, they may, instead of giving up <em>Karma</em>, simply become
lazy, idle persons, who have not really given up anything. What is the meaning
of the expression, to give up <em>Karma</em>? Krishna says that in abstaining from
doing a thing there may be the effects of active <em>Karma</em>, and in active <em>Karma</em>
there may be no real Karmic results. If you kill a man, it is murder, and you
are held responsible for it; but suppose you refuse to feed your old parents and
they die in consequence of your neglect, do you mean to say that you are not
responsible for that <em>Karma</em>? You may talk in the most metaphysical manner you
please, you cannot get rid of <em>Karma</em> altogether.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Taking all these circumstances into consideration, and admitting the many
mischievous consequences that will follow as the result of recommending every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>human being to give up <em>Karma</em>, Krishna adds all that is to be found in the
teaching that makes the Logos the means of salvation, and recommends man—if he
would seek to obtain immortality—a method by following which he is sure to reach
it, and not one that may end in his having to go through another incarnation, or
being absorbed into another spiritual being whose existence is not immortal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The recommendation to practice and obtain self-mastery, Krishna accepts. But
he would add to it more effectual means of obtaining the desired end—means sufficient
in themselves to enable you to reach that end. He points out that this practise of
self-mastery is not only useful for training in one birth, but is likely to leave permanent
impulses on a man’s soul which come to his rescue in future incarnations.”...</p>

<p class='c001'>“Krishna, in recommending his own method, combines all that is good in the five
systems, and adds thereto all those necessary means of obtaining salvation that follow
as inferences from the existence of the <em>Logos</em>, and its real relationship to man and to
all the principles that operate in the cosmos. His is certainly more comprehensive
than any of the theories from which these various schools of philosophy have started,
and it is this theory that he is trying, in the second six chapters of the <a id='corr44.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Bhavadgita'>Bhagavadgita</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_44.16'><ins class='correction' title='Bhavadgita'>Bhagavadgita</ins></a></span>,to
inculcate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In the above quoted lecture Karma was considered in its Kosmic and
universal aspect, but no attempt was made to consider it in its individual
aspect as applied to the various great sections of Being on this planet.
The first approach to this is seen in the animal kingdom. Doubtless,
the mineral and vegetable kingdoms are under the law of Harmony
with Nature; it could not possibly be otherwise for they are closer to
what is known as nature and much less individualised. But there is so
little individualisation in these kingdoms that it is hardly possible to
consider them in relation to the law of harmony, or to that of Cause
and Effect on the plane of objectivity. But to anyone who has thought
about the question it is plain that the animal kingdom, in its individuals,
does come at least under the law of cause and effect. This may
practically be called the working of Karma on the physical plane and by
some has been called the law of Compensation, this being a term
expressive of mechanical and physical energy. The word Karma had
better be retained to express the working of the law of harmony
on that plane where moral responsibility begins, and where “the
law of compensation can be modified by will and reason,” and where
therefore personal merit and demerit exists. To quote from an article
in the Theosophist on the Karma of animals:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“A piece of iron is attracted to a magnet without having any desire in the matter.
If it is exposed to air and water, it may become rusty and cannot prevent it. A plant
or a tree may be straight or crooked on account of circumstances over which it has
no control. An animal usually follows the instincts of its nature without any merit or
demerit for so doing, a child or an idiot may smilingly kick over a lamp which may
set a whole city on fire; the cause will have its effect, but the child or the idiot cannot
be held responsible for it, because they have not sufficient intelligence to fully control
their actions or to judge about the consequences. A person can only be held responsible
according to his ability to perceive justice and to distinguish between good
and evil. The power to discriminate properly is an attribute of the human mind, and
the higher that mind is developed the more it becomes responsible for the effects it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>produces. A cat may kill a mouse or an ox gore a man; and to hold them morally
responsible for it would be an act of injustice, cruelty and stupidity. Whether or not
a dog may have sufficient reason to incur any moral responsibility is a matter of
opinion, and no emphatic affirmation or denial will decide the case: but it is reasonable
to suppose that a dog, though he may have sufficient reason to know what is good
or bad for himself or for those to whom he is attached, has no moral responsibility.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Thus, though animals may be under the law of compensation, and
under the law of harmony or Karma, they <em>are not</em> under the law of
compensation, or the law of harmony or Karma in the same way as it
applies to human beings. With humanity, a fresh element has been
introduced—the intellectual, reasoning, and discriminating power. Consequently,
while the universal law of harmony or Karma governs
the whole Universe, the law of Harmony should be applied to the
Universe as a whole, and its manifestations, the laws of Karma and
Compensation, should be applied to man and animal respectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is more possible, perhaps, to consider the question in relation
to the various grades of humanity so far as we can conceive of
it and them. It would be better to commence with the highest and
proceed downwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>All Theosophists, and many who are not, have heard of Mahatmas,
and many have speculated very wrongly about them. In this magazine,
and in this article, it may be possible to write about them without
disrespect, <em>because</em> only through these speculations is it possible to
understand the law of harmony and its relation to man as Karma,
and to divinity as harmony. The word Karma as limited above does
not apply to the Mahatma.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Gazing only upon the eternal the Mahatma feels neither good nor ill, nor does
either good or ill come to him. Personally, he cannot either suffer or rejoice, and is
incapable of emotion, because he is indifferent to circumstances. But as he developes,
his sympathies increase, until at last his sympathies enter into all beings, and with
them he rejoices and suffers until they also pass beyond the sense of joy or pain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They do not have good or evil Karma. The glory and good fortune and happiness,
these go to the good men who look for temporary joys. Karma produces pleasure or
pain by the ordering of circumstances. The Mahatma does not feel pleasure and
pain, and is not affected by circumstances, therefore he is Karmaless. The law of
cause and effect is only called Karma when it concerns temporary and changing
circumstances. The acts of the Mahatma generate spiritual energy which goes to
create the power that shall be his when he is no longer man, and consequently form an
eternal factor in his future; thus, the Mahatma, being without personal desire, is
outside the operation of the law of Karma.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In his real condition he is in harmony with Nature, and its agent, and
hence outside Karma. His physical body is however still within its
limits of action. But to him this is a very small matter.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>THE MYSTERY OF ALL TIME.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The inner light which guides men to greatness, and makes them
noble, is a mystery through all time and must remain so while
Time lasts for us; but there come moments, even in the midst
of ordinary life, when Time has no hold upon us, and then all the
circumstance of outward existence falls away, and we find ourselves face
to face with the mystery beyond. In great trouble, in great joy, in keen
excitement, in serious illness, these moments come. Afterwards they
seem very wonderful, looking back upon them.</p>

<p class='c028'>What is this mystery, and why is it so veiled, are the burning
questions for anyone who has begun to realise its existence. Trouble
most often rouses men to the consciousness of it, and forces them to
ask these questions when those, whom one has loved better than
oneself, are taken away into the formless abyss of the unknown by
death, or are changed, by the experiences of life, till they are no longer
recognisable as the same; then comes the wild hunger for knowledge.
Why is it so? What is it, that surrounds us with a great dim cloud
into which all loved things plunge in time and are lost to us, obliterated,
utterly taken from us? It is this which makes life so unbearable to the
emotional natures, and which developes selfishness in narrow hearts. If
there is no certainty and no permanence in life, then it seems to the
Egotist, that there is no reasonable course but to attend to one’s own
affairs, and be content with the happiness of the first person singular.
There are many persons sufficiently generous in temperament to wish
others were happy also, and who, if they saw any way to do it, would
gladly redress some of the existing ills—the misery of the poor, the
social evil, the sufferings of the diseased, the sorrow of those made
desolate by death—these things the sentimental philanthropist shudders
to think of. He does not act because he can do so little. Shall he take
one miserable child and give it comfort when millions will be enduring
the same fate when that one is dead? The inexorable cruelty of life
continues on its giant course, and those who are born rich and healthy
live in pleasant places, afraid to think of the horrors life holds within
it. Loss, despair, unutterable pain, comes at last, and the one who has
hitherto been fortunate is on a level with those to whom misery has
been familiarised by a lifetime of experience. For trouble bites hardest
when it springs on a new victim. Of course, there are profoundly
selfish natures which do not suffer in this sense, which look only for
personal comfort and are content with the small horizon visible to one
person’s sight; for these, there is but little trouble in the world, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>is none of the passionate pain which exists in sensitive and poetic
natures. The born artist is aware of pain as soon as he is aware of
pleasure; he recognises sadness as a part of human life before it has
touched on his own. He has an innate consciousness of the mystery
of the ages, that thing stirring within man’s soul and which enables him
to outlive pain and become great, which leads him on the road to the
divine life. This gives him enthusiasm, a superb heroism indifferent to
calamity; if he is a poet he will write his heart out, even for a generation
that has no eyes or ears for him; if he desires to help others personally,
he is capable of giving his very life to save one wretched child
from out a million of miserable ones. For it is not his puny personal
effort in the world that he considers—not his little show of labour done;
what he is conscious of is the over-mastering desire to work with the
beneficent forces of super-nature, to become one with the divine mystery,
and when he can forget time and circumstances, he is face to face with
that mystery. Many have fancied they must reach it by death; but
none have come back to tell us that this is so. We have no proof that
man is not as blind beyond the grave as he is on this side of it. Has
he entered the eternal thought? If not, the mystery is a mystery still.</p>

<p class='c028'>To one who is entering occultism in earnest, all the trouble of the
world seems suddenly apparent. There is a point of experience when
father and mother, wife and child, become indistinguishable, and when
they seem no more familiar or friendly than a company of strangers.
The one dearest of all may be close at hand and unchanged, and yet
is as far as if death had come between. Then all distinction between
pleasure and pain, love and hate, have vanished. A melancholy, keener
than that felt by a man in his first fierce experience of grief, overshadows
the soul. It is the pain of the struggle to break the shell in which man
has prisoned himself. Once broken then there is no more pain; all ties
are severed, all personal demands are silenced for ever. The man has
forced himself to face the great mystery, which is now a mystery no
longer, for he has become part of it. It is essentially the mystery of
the ages, and these have no longer any meaning for him to whom time
and space and all other limitations are but passing experiences. It
has become to him a reality, profound, indeed, because it is bottomless,
wide, indeed, because it is limitless. He has touched on the greatness of
life, which is sublime in its impartiality and effortless generosity. He
is friend and lover to all those living beings that come within his consciousness,
not to the one or two chosen ones only—which is indeed only
an enlarged selfishness. While a man retains his humanity, it is certain
that one or two chosen ones will give him more pleasure by contact,
than all the rest of the beings in the Universe and all the heavenly host;
but he has to remember and recognise what this preference is. It is
not a selfish thing which has to be crushed out, if the love is the love
that gives; freedom from attachments is not a meritorious condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>in itself. The freedom needed is not from those who cling to you, but
from those to whom you cling. The familiar phrase of the lover “I
cannot live without you” must be words which cannot be uttered, to
the occultist. If he has but one anchor, the great tides will sweep
him away into nothingness. But the natural preference which must
exist in every man for a few persons is one form of the lessons of Life.
By contact with these other souls he has other channels by which to
penetrate to the great mystery. For every soul touches it, even the
darkest. Solitude is a great teacher, but society is even greater. It is
so hard to find and take the highest part of those we love, that in the
very difficulty of the search there is a serious education. We realise
when making that effort, far more clearly what it is that creates the
mystery in which we live, and makes us so ignorant. It is the swaying,
vibrating, never-resting desires of the animal soul in man. The life of
this part of man’s nature is so vigorous and strongly developed from the
ages during which he has dwelt in it, that it is almost impossible to still
it so as to obtain contact with the noble spirit. This constant and
confusing life, this ceaseless occupation with the trifles of the hour, this
readiness in surface emotion, this quickness to be pleased, amused or
distressed, is what baffles our sight and dulls our inner senses. Till we
can use these the mystery remains in its Sphinx-like silence.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS OF BUDDHISM.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>When a man immersed in the darkness of modern civilization
awakens, however slightly, to the hollowness of his every-day
life, he becomes sensible of a feeling of despair, for he is
mentally brought face to face with what appears to him to be a
meaningless yet cruel destiny. Now to any one so circumstanced, no
truer source of consolation and encouragement can be offered than that
which is to be found in a proper consideration of the “Four Noble
Truths” of Buddhism. But to give this proper consideration to the
Truths, or indeed to promote even a preliminary enquiry into their
nature is by no means an easy task, because the fundamental ideas
which they embody have scarcely any vitality in the present generation;
nay more, they involve for the most part a complete inversion of
maxims commonly accepted as axiomatic in current thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is, however, in the hopes of doing something towards the elucidation
of the matter, that the present exposition is attempted.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first Noble Truth relates to human suffering. It proclaims that
the conscious, separated, life of individual existence necessarily implies
pain, sorrow and misery; that so long as a man feels that he is possessed
of an <em>isolated self</em>, or so long as he regards himself and his fellow men
as <em>detached personalities</em>, having antagonistic or even independent interests,
so long must he suffer and be subject to trouble, grief and disappointment.</p>

<p class='c028'>This first Noble Truth gives utterance to one aspect of an inexorable
law of universal application, a law from whose operations no man can,
or has, or ever will escape, until he has learnt and in the fullest sense
realized the four Noble Truths.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first Truth may also be thus expressed: individual existence necessitates
and involves change of state, whether manifested as birth
growth, decay or death, and all changes of state are accompanied by
pain in one form or another on some plane of being; while those who
seem in their own eyes to have escaped from pain, or those who imagine
that others escape from it, are alike deluded, for all men are overtaken by
it soon or late.</p>

<p class='c028'>The second Noble Truth deals with the cause of pain, and partially
explains its meaning. According to this Truth, it is the desire or thirst
for the continuance of individual life, with its various sensations and experiences,
that constitutes the true basis of all suffering, whatever the
outward form it may assume, and to whatever plane of consciousness
it may belong. This thirst for life, called in the Sanscrit language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Tanha, gives rise in the mind of man to a delusive belief in the
<em>permanence</em> and <em>reality</em> of that separate personality, which, according to
Buddhism, is no more than an ephemeral mode of individual existence;
it further leads him to suppose that the numerous mental states which
in their aggregate make up the personality, are, in themselves <em>real</em>; and
hence grows that rooted belief in the absolute reality of the manifold
objects of sense, and that longing for their possession, that insatiable
longing for the enhancement and for the multiplication of the experiences
associated with these objects.</p>

<p class='c028'>The second Truth, like the first, presents an aspect of the universal
law already referred to.</p>

<p class='c028'>This law, the Sanscrit name for which is Karma, is the governing and
controlling power, ordering all individual existence, and by virtue of
which Tanha operates.</p>

<p class='c028'>The third Noble Truth announces the fact that, as the individual man
grows strong in spiritual knowledge and charity, so Tanha is gradually
dissolved, and there is for him a consequent cessation of sorrow and of
pain. The individuality becoming proportionately freed from the
bondage of Karma, Tanha is indeed a quite necessary adjunct of
man’s incipient growth, for it represents the <em>creative</em> power which forces
the individuality through the earlier stages of its development, yet,
while performing this most useful function, being in fact indispensable
to the lower nature of man, Tanha, at the same time, forges those
Karmic fetters from which the spiritual self struggles desperately to
get free.</p>

<p class='c028'>As the man’s spiritual nature is evolved, the unconscious creative
energy, in form of Tanha, is gradually replaced by the newly developed
powers of the higher self, the <em>will</em> becomes more and more completely
associated with the spirit, while the man himself, endowed with true
Faith, true Hope, and true Love, becomes a conscious co-worker with
the Universal or Macrocosmic Will, the “Great Builder.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The fourth Noble Truth assures us that there is a way by which all
men may, if they only choose, rapidly accomplish this displacement of
Tanha by true Love; this way is called the Noble Eight-fold Path leading
to enlightenment.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus:—1. Right fundamental Belief, <i>i.e.</i>, the right basis mentally
and spiritually upon which to establish true knowledge. 2. Right Intention,
<i>i.e.</i>, goodwill towards all that lives, singleness of purpose, correctness
and purity of motive. 3. Right Speech, <i>i.e.</i>, the use of becoming
language, kindly temperate, fair and profitable; patient yet vigorous;
thoughtful, courageous, honest and discriminating. 4. Right Behaviour
<i>i.e.</i>, active philanthropy. 5. Right means of Livelihood, <i>i.e.</i>, honest and
useful employment of one’s time, paying adequate attention to one’s
own material needs and helping others to do the same, yet without care
for the morrow. 6. Right Endeavour, <i>i.e.</i>, putting one’s heart in one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>work. 7. Right Loneliness, <i>i.e.</i>, self-contained and harmonious <a id='corr51.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='within'>within.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_51.1'><ins class='correction' title='within'>within.</ins></a></span>
8. Right Meditation. This is the Sanskrit <em>Yoga</em> and signifies union
with the divine by practising the contemplation of the reality of being.
It is the result of a sustained effort to concentrate the mind upon the
universal, eternal and immutable law of life; the first stage of such
concentration takes the form of an impartial review or survey of all one’s
thoughts, actions, desires, sensations and experiences from a thoroughly
impersonal standpoint. This Eightfold Path has four stages representing
different degrees of advancement towards Buddhahood or the state of
perfect enlightenment. The true Buddha or Tathâgata is one who
has attained final emancipation from individual existence, whose
purified spirit is freed from the last vestige of Tanha, one upon whom
Karma has no more hold, for he has reached Para Nirvana, the <em>Eternal</em>,
the Absolute Being.</p>

<p class='c028'>THE LAST OF A GOOD LAMA.—Whatever may be said against godless Buddhism,
its influence, wherever it penetrates, is most beneficent. One finds the Spirit of
“Lord Buddha ... most pitiful, the Teacher of Nirvâna and the Law,” ennobling
even the least philosophical of the dissenting sects of his religion—the Lamäism of the
nomadic Kalmucks. The Caspian Steppes witnessed, only a few months ago, the
solemn cremation and burial of a Mongolian saint, whose ashes were watered by as
many Christian as Lamaic tears. The high priest to the Russian Calmucks of the
Volga died December 26th, 1886, near Vétlyanka, once the seat of the most terrible
epidemics. The Ghelungs had chosen the day of ceremony in accordance with their
sacred books; the hour was fixed astrologically, and at noon on January 4th, 1887, the
imposing ceremony took place. More than 80,000 people assembling from all the
neighbouring Cossack <em>stanitzas</em> and Calmuck <em>ooloosses</em>, formed a procession surrounding
the pillar of cremation. The corpse having been fixed in an iron arm-chair, used on
such ceremonies, was introduced into the hollow pillar, the flames being fed with
supplies of fresh butter. During the whole burning, the crowd never ceased weeping
and lamenting, the Russians being most violent in their expressions of sorrow, and
with reason. For long years the defunct Lama had been a kind father to all the poor
in the country, whether Christian or Lamaist. Whole villages of proletarians had been
fed, clothed, and their poll-taxes paid out of his own private income. His property in
pasture lands, cattle, and tithes was very large, yet the Lama was ever in want of money.
With his death, the poor wretches, who could hardly keep soul in their bodies, have no
prospect but starvation. Thus the tears of the Christians were as abundant, if not
quite as unselfish, as those of the poor Pagans. Only the year before, the good Lama
received 4,000 roubles from a Calmuck <em>oolooss</em> (camp) and gave the whole to rebuild
a burned down Russian village, and thus saved hundreds from death by hunger. He
was never known during his long life to refuse any man, woman, or child, in need,
whether Pagan or Christian, depriving himself of every comfort to help his poorer
fellow-creatures. Thus died the last of the Lamas of the priestly hierarchy sent to the
Astrakhan Calmucks from beyond the “Snowy Range” some sixty years ago. A
shameful story is told of how a travelling Christian pilgrim imposed on the good Lama.
The Lama had entrusted him with 30,000 roubles to be placed in the neighbouring
town; but the Christian pilgrim disappeared, and the money with him.</p>

aromas of Heaven, and looks lovingly on her sisters; clad in her dazzling
garments, and her brow adorned with diamonds, she smiles as she sings
her morning and her evening hymn; she enjoys an eternal repose which
nothing can disturb, and solemnly she treads the path assigned to her
among the sentinels of light.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the wandering comet, all bloodstained, and her tresses unloosed,
rushes on from the depths of the sky; she dashes across the track of the
peaceful spheres like a chariot of war breaking the ranks of a procession
of vestals; she dares to breast the burning sword of the guardians of
the sun, and, like a lost spouse who seeks the partner visioned in her
lonely night watches, she forces her way even into the tabernacle of the
King of Day.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then she rushes out, breathing forth the fires which consume herself
and leaving in her train one long conflagration; the stars pale before
her approach, the herded constellations, which browse upon the starry
flowers in the vast meadows of the sky, seem to flee from her terrible
breath. The grand council of the stars is called, and universal consternation
reigns. At last the fairest of the fixed stars is charged to
speak in the name of the heavenly concourse, and to propose a truce
with the errant messenger.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My sister,” she says, “why troublest thou the harmony of these
spheres? What harm have we done thee, and why, instead of wandering
at hazard, dost thou not, like us, take up thy settled rank in the Court
of the Sun? Why dost thou not join with us in chanting the evening
hymn, attired, like us, in a robe of white clasped above the breast by
one pure diamond? Why dost thou allow thy tresses, dripping with the
sweat of fire, to float across the vapours of the night? If thou wouldst
but take thy due place among the daughters of Heaven, how far more
lovely thy mien! Thy face no more would be burnt up by the fatigue
of thy unheard-of journeys; thy eyes would shine forth clear, and
thy features smile with the tints of lily and of rose, like those of thy
happy sisters; all the stars would recognise in thee a friend, and far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>from fearing thy transit, they would rejoice at thy approach. For
thou wouldst be united to us by the indissoluble ties of universal
harmony, and thy peaceable existence would be but one voice the more
in the anthem of Infinite Love.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But the comet replies:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Deem not, my sister, that I could stray at chance and disturb the
harmony of the spheres. God has traced for me my path, as thine for
thee, and if my course appears to thee uncertain and erratic, it is
because thy rays cannot reach so far as to embrace the outlines of the
great ellipse which has been given me for my career. My burning
tresses are the banner of God; I am the messenger of the Suns, and
I bathe me in their fires that I may distribute them on my path to those
young worlds which have not yet sufficient heat, and to the declining
stars that shiver in their solitude. If I court fatigue in my long
journeyings, if my beauty is less mild than thine, if my attire less
virginal, I am no less than thee a worthy daughter of the sky. Leave
in my hands the awful secret of my destiny, leave to me the horror
which encompasses me, and slander me not if thou canst not understand
me. None the less, shall I fulfil my appointed task. Happy the stars
that take their rest and shine like young queens in the stately concourse
of the Universe; for me, I am cast out, a wanderer, and claim the Infinite
as my only fatherland. They accuse me of setting on fire the planets
which I warm, and of terrifying the stars which I illume. I am reproached
with disturbing the harmony of the worlds, because I do not
revolve round their own fixed points, and because I bind them one to
the other, setting my face alone toward the only centre of all the Suns.
So rest assured, thou fairest star, I will not deprive thee of one ray of
thy so peaceful light; the rather, I will squander on thee my warmth
and my own life. Who knows, but I may vanish from the sky when I
have consumed myself? My lot will still have been a noble one! For
know that in the Temple of God the fires that burn are not all one. Ye
are the light of the golden torches, but I, the flame of sacrifice. Let
each accomplish her own destiny!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Her words scarce uttered, the comet shakes her tresses loose, covers
herself with her burning shield, and plunges once more into infinite
space, where she appears to vanish for evermore.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is thus that Lucifer appears and disappears in the allegories of the Bible.</p>

<p class='c028'>One day, so says the book of Job, the sons of God had assembled in
the presence of their Lord, and among them came Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c028'>To him the Lord said: “Whence comest thou?”</p>

<p class='c028'>And he replied:</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have journeyed round the world and travelled throughout it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is how a Gnostic gospel, re-discovered in the East by a learned
traveller, explains, in treating of the symbolical Lucifer, the genesis of
Light.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Truth which is conscious of itself is living Thought. Truth is the
Thought which is contained within itself; and formulated Thought is
Speech. When the Eternal Thought sought for a <em>form</em> it said: ‘Let
there be Light.’ Therefore this Thought that speaks is the <em>Word</em>, and
this Word says: ‘Let there be Light, because the word itself is the light
of the <em>spirit</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c028'>The uncreated light, which is the divine Word, sends forth its rays
because it wishes to be manifest, and when it says, “Let there be light,”
it commands the eyes to open; it creates the <em>Intelligences</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>And, when God said: “Let there be light,” Intelligence was made
and light appeared.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then, the Intelligence which God had breathed forth, like a planet
detached from the Sun, took the form of a splendid Angel and the
heavens saluted him with the name of Lucifer.</p>

<p class='c028'>Intelligence awoke and it fathomed its own depths as it heard this
apostrophe of the divine Word, “Let there be Light.” It felt itself to
be free, for God had commanded it so to be, and it answered, raising its
head and spreading its wings, “I will not be Slavery.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Wilt thou be then Sorrow?” said the uncreated voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will be Liberty,” answered the Light.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Pride will seduce thee,” replied the supreme voice, “and thou wilt
give birth to Death.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I must needs combat with Death to conquer Life,” said once again
the light created.</p>

<p class='c028'>God then unloosed from his bosom the thread of splendour which held
back the superb spirit, and as he watched him dive into the night, cutting
in it a path of glory, he loved the child of his thought, and smiling with
a smile ineffable, he murmured to himself: “How fair a thing was
this Light!”</p>

<p class='c028'>And Sorrow was the condition imposed upon the free being. If the
chief of the angels had not dared confront the depths of night, the
travail of God had not been complete, and the created light could not
have separated itself from the light unrevealed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Perhaps Lucifer, in plunging into the night, drew with him a shower
of Stars and Suns <em>by the attraction of his glory</em>? * * * * * * *</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h3 class='c018'>A TRUE THEOSOPHIST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>A very large majority of people have no idea whatever about
Theosophy, and regard Theosophists as more or less crazy
members of a new sect. They naturally deny any superiority
to one new sect among so many, and aver that, as a considerable number
of sects have been “tried in the balances and found wanting,” this one
is no better than its predecessors. Theosophists—the real ones—can
only reply that they are unsectarian and superior to none. They believe
that they have found a good road to the discovery of truth, and wish to
share their discovery—if it can be so called—with others.</p>

<p class='c028'>The very assumption of superiority would be a contradiction in terms
to the name itself. But, while giving this emphatic denial with reference
to the name “Theosophist,” no attempt is made to assert that all
members of the Theosophical Society are also Theosophists. True
indeed, that when they enter that society, they subscribe to rules and
declare their objects to be such that, were they to carry them out
thoroughly, no other name than Theosophists would be applicable.
Nor does the name imply that, in the studies which Theosophists make
their own, it is necessary that the sole and best place should be given to
studies of Oriental philosophy. That again would be a contradiction,
for it has most emphatically been stated that “there are those who are
ignorant of the Eastern wisdom” who are nearer to divine wisdom, than
some who have devoted their entire lives to Oriental studies. It is
again the old story that, “the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Still while holding to the assertion that the study of Oriental wisdom
is only one road out of many, it is necessary to remember the analogy
which philology may here present to “religion.” Just as philology traces
all languages to a common root—the Sanskrit or rather pre-Sanskrit—so
the religions of the world can also be traced to a common root and
birth place, identical with the cradle and birth place of the human
race, which ethnology locates on the high plateaux of Central <a id='corr55.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Asia'>Asia.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.31'><ins class='correction' title='Asia'>Asia.</ins></a></span>
Therefore it is, that the study of Oriental philosophy has something to
be urged in its especial favour, because that philosophy has its home
nearer to the source of the wisdom religion than any other.</p>

<p class='c028'>Still more must it be borne in mind, that members of the Theosophical
Society are not necessarily Theosophists, for a very considerable number
are attracted merely by the name and through curiosity. They either
do not understand what they profess, or if they do, they do not practise
it. But this is no attempt to run counter to the proverb, that the tree
is known by its fruit, although there is some amount of injustice in <a id='corr55.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it'>it.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_55.40'><ins class='correction' title='it'>it.</ins></a></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>All that is asserted is that, if this argument is used against a Society
with aims and aspirations such as the Theosophical Society has, it can
be used with even more terrible effect against <em>all</em> religions whether
Christian, Mohammedan, Buddhist, etc. The real reason why this has
come to pass, lies in a few words—the cultivation of the individual;
and, as a later result of this, in anthropomorphism. It is only those
individuals who can “grasp their whole individuality firmly,” and by
the force of their “awakened spiritual will, reach out to the life beyond
individuality”—it is only they, who can shake themselves loose from the
curse which has gradually spread over the whole world. It is in consequence
of this growth of individualism that the “blessings of civilization”
have become the curse of mankind, and every religion, originally
altruistic, has become inverted, and the reign of anti-Christ and hypocrisy
has superseded that of Christ and truth. No sweeping accusation is
made against the whole world in this statement. A dim and misty veil
has been thrown over the face of Truth, and it is as though we saw
everything outside the principal focus of a lens, and consequently, under
full faith that we see the real image, perceive the inverted image. In
the time of Elizabeth, for instance, men learnt to cultivate the individual
within the circle of the race, and to attempt to unite in patriotism for
the benefit of that race or empire. But it is a vain attempt, and the
dissociating effects of this culture will soon be evident in the impossibility
of the attempt. Originally the attempt was to cultivate the individual,
but only with a view to the increase of that race and with that object as
paramount. That is to say, that an English soldier would cultivate
himself to the uttermost in order that the world should see what English
soldiers were. But the time came when the egoistic element appeared
in overwhelming force, and the cultivation was devoted to the sole aim
of making this or that man stronger than any man of his own race, or
any other.</p>

<p class='c028'>And now another aim has been substituted for the paramount one of
patriotism. Mammon has superseded the latter, and the strength of the
individual is cultivated and devoted to withstanding the pressure of life,
and to getting a start in the great race to worship at the feet of the
demon of cupidity. But again, while devoting their own lives and
worse—the lives of their neighbours—to this worship, they yet professed
to be Christians or members of other religions. They tried to worship
two gods—Mammon on six days of the week and the other divinity on
Sunday, or any day set apart for his service. But still, in most cases,
it was not the divine instinct of search for the divine in their hearts, but
a fear of wrath to come. It really was a pharisaical idea of “hedging,”
to use a term of racing slang, with reference to the race of life. The end
of it was that Mammon received the real worship of their hearts, and the
other god only lip-service. Thus in the end hypocrisy became almost as
paramount as Mammon. Time still passed on, and man almost lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>sight of any idea of an offended and avenging deity, and any germ of
spirituality was very nearly dead from want of cultivation. The
material needs held him in complete sway, and the spread of physical
science helped him mightily. Losing sight of all the subtler side of
nature, he immersed himself in gross matter, and utilitarianism was the
watchword and rallying cry. In all this change the age of mechanical
inventions took no small part. Man can hardly be blamed as an individual
nor as a whole. It is part of the great law of evolution, and
the working out of the law of the survival of the fittest.</p>

<p class='c028'>It may be asked what this has to do with the subject of the article;
but in justification it is averred that a picture is most clearly seen by its
contrast.</p>

<p class='c028'>Perhaps the best definition of a Theosophist, is that given by the
Alchemist, Thomas Vaughan:</p>

<p class='c028'>“A Theosophist is one who gives you a theory of the works of God,
which has not a revelation, but an inspiration of his own for basis.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“A man once abandoning the old pathway of routine and entering on
the solitary pathway of independent thought—Godward—he is a
Theosophist, an original thinker, a seeker after the Eternal Truth, with
an inspiration of his own to solve the Eternal problems.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Such a one as this is the subject of the article. Count Tolstoi, the
Russian novelist, is a true Theosophist, and his words and actions in
contradiction and illustration of the foregoing, are taken from an interview
with him by Mr. George Kennan (<cite>Century</cite>, June 1887). The
interview first describes the surroundings amidst which Count
Tolstoi lives, and gives also a description of the Count’s appearance.</p>

<p class='c035'>Apparently the first thing which impressed Mr. Kennan was the sight
of “a wealthy Russian noble, and the greatest of living novelists, shaking
hands upon terms of perfect equality with a poor, ragged, and not over
clean droshky driver,” who had been engaged in the streets.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then follows a description of the rooms, the furniture &amp;c., which was
observed during the time that Mr. Kennan’s host had retired—not,
indeed, to change his coat, but to put one on after a morning’s labour in
the fields. Mr. Kennan, it seems, had journeyed through Siberia, and
had there promised several of the exiles to visit Count Tolstoi on his
return, and to tell him of their condition. In the course of conversation
on these matters, Mr. Kennan asked Count Tolstoi whether he did not
think that resistance to such oppression as the exiles had experienced
was justifiable?</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“That depends,” he replied, “upon what you mean by resistance; if you mean
persuasion, argument, protest, I answer yes; if you mean violence—no. I do not
believe that violent resistance to evil is ever justifiable under any circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He then set forth clearly, eloquently, and with more feeling than he had yet shown,
the views with regard to man’s duty as a member of society which are contained in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>book entitled “My Religion,” and which are further explained and illustrated in a
number of his recently published tracts for the people. He laid particular stress upon
the doctrine of non-resistance to evil, which, he said, is in accordance with both the
teachings of Christ and the results of human experience. He declared that violence,
as a means of redressing wrongs, is not only futile, but an aggravation of the original
evil, since it is the nature of violence to multiply and reproduce itself in all directions.
“The Revolutionists,” he said, “whom you have seen in Siberia, undertook to resist
evil by violence, and what has been the result? Bitterness, and misery, and hatred,
and bloodshed! The evils against which they took up arms still exist, and to them
has been added a mass of previously non-existent human suffering. It is not in that
way that the kingdom of God is to be realised on earth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>For a long time I did not suggest any difficulties or raise any objections.... It
is one thing to ask a man in a general way whether he would use violence to resist
evil, and quite another thing to ask him specifically whether he would knock down a
burglar who was about to cut the throat of his mother. Many men would say <em>yes</em> to
the first question who would hesitate at the second. Count Tolstoi, however, was
consistent. I related to him many cases of cruelty, brutality, and oppression which
had come to my knowledge in Siberia, and at the end of every recital I said to him,
“Count Tolstoi, if you had been there and had witnessed that transaction, would you
not have interfered  with violence?” He invariably answered “No.” I asked him the
direct question whether he would kill a highwayman who was about to murder an
innocent traveller, provided there were no other way to save the traveller’s life. He
replied, “If I should see a bear about to kill a peasant in the forest, I would sink an
axe in the bear’s head; but I would not kill a man who was about to do the same
thing.” There finally came into my mind a case which, although really not worse than
many that I had already presented to him, would, I thought, appeal with peculiar force
to a brave, sensitive, chivalrous man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>This was a case of most brutal treatment of a young girl who was
exiled to Siberia. At a certain town on her journey the governor
ordered that she was to put on the clothing of an ordinary convict.
This she declined to do on the ground that administrative exiles had the
right to wear their own clothing. Furthermore the clothing supplied to
convicts is not always new, and it is quite possible that it is of the
filthiest description and full of vermin. She argued that she would have
been compelled to change at Moscow had it been necessary, and again
declined. The local governor persisted and ordered that force should be
used to effect the change. Accordingly, in the presence of nine or ten
men, the change of clothing was effected—she was stripped naked,
forcibly reclothed, and left bleeding and exhausted after ineffectual
resistance.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Now,” I said, “suppose all this had occurred in your presence; suppose that this
bleeding, defenceless, half-naked girl had appealed to you for protection, and had
thrown herself into your arms; suppose that it had been your daughter, would you
still have refused to interfere by an act of violence?”</p>

<p class='c028'>He was silent. Finally, ignoring my direct question as to what he personally would
have done in such a case, Count Tolstoi said, “Even under such circumstances violence
would not be justifiable. Let us analyse that situation carefully. I will grant, for the
sake of argument, that the local governor who ordered the act of violence was an
ignorant man, a cruel man, a brutal man—what you will; but he probably had an idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>that he was doing his duty; he probably believed that he was enforcing a law of the
Government to which he owed obedience and service. You suddenly appear and set
yourself up as a judge in the case; you assume that he is not doing his duty—that he
is committing an act of unjustifiable violence—and then, with strange inconsistency,
you proceed to aggravate and complicate the evil by yourself committing another act
of unjustifiable violence. One wrong added to another wrong does not make a right;
it merely extends the area of wrong. Furthermore, your resistance, in order to be
effective—in order to accomplish anything—must be directed against the soldiers who
are committing the assault. But those soldiers are not free agents; they are subject to
military discipline and are acting under orders which they dare not disobey. To
prevent the execution of the orders you must kill or maim two or three of the soldiers—that
is, kill or wound the only parties to the transaction who are certainly innocent,
who are manifestly acting without malice and without evil intention. Is that just? Is
it rational? But go a step further: suppose that you do kill or wound two or three of
the soldiers; you may or may not thus succeed in preventing the completion of the
act against which your violence is a protest; but one thing you certainly will do, and
that is, extend the area of enmity, injustice, and misery. Every one of the soldiers
whom you kill or maim has a family, and upon every such family you bring grief and
suffering which would not have come to it but for your act. In the hearts of perhaps
a score of people you rouse the anti-Christian and anti-social emotions of hatred and
revenge, and thus sow broadcast the seeds of further violence and strife. At the time
when you interposed there was only one centre of evil and suffering. By your violent
interference you have created half-a-dozen such centres. It does not seem to me, Mr.
Kennan, that that is the way to bring about the reign of peace and good-will on earth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Kennan had a manuscript written by one of those prisoners who
took part in the desperate “hunger-strike” of 1884, with which he had
been entrusted to hand on to Count Tolstoi. He read two or three
pages of it, and then, alluding to the Nihilists, condemned their methods
most heartily. Mr. Kennan appeared rather to sympathise with their
motives. Count Tolstoi appears only to do so partially, and, while he
earnestly desires a revolution, declines to have anything to do with one
brought about by violence. Mr. Kennan objected that violence might
close the mouth of the peaceable revolutionist and prevent his teaching
and thoughts from ever becoming public.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“But do you not see,” replied the Count, “that if you claim and exercise the right
to resist by an act of violence what you regard as evil, every other man will insist upon
his right to resist in the same way what he regards as evil, and the world will continue
to be filled with violence? It is your duty to show that there is a better way.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“But,” I objected, “you cannot show anything if somebody smites you on the
mouth every time you open it to speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You can at least refrain from striking back,” replied the Count; “you can show
by your peaceable behaviour that you are not governed by the barbarous law of
retaliation, and your adversary will not continue to strike a man who neither resists nor
tries to defend himself. It is by those who have suffered, not by those who have
inflicted suffering, that the world has been advanced.”</p>

<p class='c028'>I said it seemed to me that the advancement of the world had been promoted not a
little by the protests—and often the violent and bloody protests—of its inhabitants
against wrong and outrage, and that all history goes to show that a people which
tamely submits to oppression never acquires either liberty or happiness.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The whole history of the world,” replied the Count, “is a history of violence, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>you can of course cite violence in support of violence; but do you not see that there is
in human society an endless variety of opinions as to what constitutes wrong and
oppression, and that if you once concede the right of any man to resort to violence to
resist what he regards as wrong, he being the judge, you authorise every other man
to enforce his opinions in the same way, and you have a universal reign of violence?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Count Tolstoi considers it <a id='corr60.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='necssary'>necessary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_60.6'><ins class='correction' title='necssary'>necessary</ins></a></span> to labour for and help the poor by
whom he is surrounded; but he is keenly alive to the danger of pauperising
them. In doing this he runs counter to the ideas of organised society
and the existing traits of human character. He declines to regard these
as sacred and immutable, and is doing what he can to change them.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Count Tolstoi then related with great fulness of detail the history of his change of
attitude toward the teaching of Christ, and the steps by which he was brought to see
that that teaching, rightly understood, furnishes a reasonable solution of some of the
darkest problems of human life. He based upon it not only his opposition to resistance
as a means of overcoming evil, but his hostility to courts of justice, established churches,
class distinctions, private property, and all civil and ecclesiastical organisation in
existing forms. His frequent references to the New Testament, and his insistence on
the precepts of Christ as furnishing the only rule for the right government of human
conduct, might lead one to regard Count Tolstoi as a devout and orthodox Christian,
but, judged by a doctrinal standard, he is very far from being so. He rejects the whole
doctrinal framework of the Christian scheme of redemption, including original sin,
atonement, the triune personality of God, and the divinity of Christ, and has very little
faith in the immortality of the soul. His religion is a religion of this world, and it is
based almost wholly upon terrestrial considerations. If he refers frequently to the
teachings of Christ, and accepts Christ’s precepts as the rules which should govern
human conduct, it is not because he believes that Christ was God, but because he
regards those precepts as a formal embodiment of the highest and noblest philosophy
of life, and as a revelation, in a certain sense, of the Divine will and character. He
insists, however, that Christ’s precepts shall be understood—and that they were intended
to be understood—literally and in their most obvious sense. He will not
recognise nor tolerate any softening or modification of a hard commandment by subtle
and plausible interpretation. If Christ said, ‘Resist not evil,’ he meant resist not
evil. He did not mean resist not evil if you can help it, nor resist not evil unless it is
unbearable; he meant resist not at all. How unflinchingly Count Tolstoi faces the
logical results of his system of belief I have tried to show.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Count Tolstoi’s views as to his own action and practice have been
recently published in an authorised interview which appeared in a
Russian journal. He said:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“People say to me, ‘Well, Lef Nikolaivitch, as far as preaching goes, you preach;
but how about your practice?’ The question is a perfectly natural one; it is always
put to me, and it always shuts my mouth. ‘You preach,’ it is said, ‘but how do you
live?’ I can only reply that I do not preach—passionately as I desire to do so. I
might preach through my actions, but my actions are bad. That which I say is not
preaching; it is only an attempt to find out the meaning and the significance of life.
People often say to me, ‘If you think that there is no reasonable life outside the
teachings of Christ, and if you love a reasonable life, why do you not fulfill the
Christian precepts?’ I am guilty and blameworthy and contemptible because I do
not fulfill them; but at the same time I say—not in justification, but in explanation,
of my inconsistency—Compare my previous life with the life I am now living, and
you will see that I am trying to fulfill. I have not, it is true, fulfilled one eighty-thousandth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>part, and I am to blame for it; but it is not because I do not wish to fulfill
all, but because I am unable. Teach me how to extricate myself from the meshes of
temptation in which I am entangled—help me—and I will fulfill all. I wish and hope
to do it even without help. Condemn me if you choose—I do that myself—but condemn
me, and not the path which I am following, and which I point out to those who ask me
where, in my opinion, the path is. If I know the road home, and if I go along it
drunk, and staggering from side to side, does that prove that the road is not the right
one? If it is not the right one, show me another. If I stagger and wander, come to
my help, and support and guide me in the right path. Do not yourselves confuse and
mislead me, and then rejoice over it and cry, ‘Look at him! He says he is going
home, and he is floundering into the swamp!’ You are not evil spirits from the
swamp; you are also human beings, and you also are going home. You know that I
am alone—you know that I cannot wish or intend to go into the swamp—then help
me! My heart is breaking with despair because we have all lost the road; and while
I struggle with all my strength to find it and keep in it, you, instead of pitying me
when I go astray, cry triumphantly, ‘See! He is in the swamp with us!’”</p>

<p class='c028'>In this report of Count Tolstoi, it is impossible not to recognise the
generous, just, and sympathetic man—the true Theosophist. He may be
mistaken, but he is endeavouring to carry out the precepts of Christ.
Not indeed, doctrinal Christianity, but to put in practice the actual
precepts of the Master he follows. He does this as far as he can; and
even with this little (as he says) he is accused of quixotism, and is
obliged to stay his hand in order to keep up the example he affords.
Why is this. For fear of interested relatives and the lunatic asylum.
Here we have a man endeavouring to carry out “under an inspiration
of his own,” the precepts laid down by the last of the world’s great teachers.
What is the result of his endeavours? That he is in danger of the same
fate that the author of “Modern Christianity a civilized Heathenism,”
threatened Christ with, were he to return in the XIXth century—the
lunatic asylum. Nothing is so intolerable to modern minds as an
example of what they (unconsciously to themselves) recognise as that
which they ought to follow, but do not. Therefore it has to be put out
of sight. Since madness has been defined as a mental state which is in
contradiction to the average mental state, it is evident that all religious
reformers ought to be put away in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is quite possible to recognise what an extraordinary effect Count
Tolstoi’s principle of non-resistance to evil would have. Still it is a
strictly Christian one. Christ went further, and ordained that the other
cheek should be offered to the man who smites. It might be argued that
this would result in a tacit acquiescence in evil. But if it be so, the whole
of the Count’s life is a contradiction to this, and a standing protest against
the existence of those who create, or rather perpetuate, this evil. Every
reform, this included, is a protest against doing at Rome what Romans
do, or the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laisser aller</i></span>, which is the indolent curse of human progress.
Count Tolstoi desires to see the reign of Christ on Earth, and in this
accords well with the Theosophists who desire “Universal Brotherhood.”
But neither of these can be effected save by the cultivation of the inner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>and spiritual man, so that it shall shine through and form the guide to
the outer and physical man. But unfortunately the welfare of the latter
is taken as the standard at present and humanity, without the spiritual
man as a guide, is left to flounder in the ditch into which it has
fallen.</p>

<p class='c028'>Those who desire to follow Count Tolstoi, or to become real working
Theosophists, may find something to think about in comparing his words
with his actions. He endeavours to “go about doing good,” and to
help his fellow men on the hard path of life. When it is followed it will
be found that to run counter to the spirit of the age, and instead of the
indolent <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laisser aller</i></span>, to work not for self, but for humanity at large, is
the hardest task ever set to men. Mankind as a rule does not want an
example or to be worked for; both are rude awakenings from the lotus-eating
state they desire to be left in. “Let us alone,” is their cry, and
they resist with violence any attempt to rouse them.</p>

<p class='c028'>But those who desire a greater unity than that which any race or
nation can afford—the unity of the human race—the Universal Brotherhood—cannot
leave them alone. There is a power which impels Count
Tolstoi to protest against the reign of violence, and he truly replies,
that the readiest means of continuing this reign is to meet violence by
violence. Therefore he, by his writings, and his words and life, endeavours
to place before men the noblest philosophy of life that he recognises,
in answer to the appeal which is silently uttered from the hearts
of many men and women in the world.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is a cry of despair at the ignorance which surrounds them and to
which the Theosophical Society, <em>according to its avowed aims</em>, is an
answer. It is best described in the words of Tennyson—</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>A GHOST’S REVENGE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>Early in the year 187—, the singular and distressing attacks of
mental depression from which Sir Selwyn Fox had long been
a sufferer, increased in frequency.</p>

<p class='c028'>His son Gaston (twenty-four years of age, of medicine by calling and
letters by choice), whose devotion to his father was intense, urged him
to go to London and procure that skilled medical advice which was
not to be had in the neighbourhood of the baronet’s country seat, in
Northumberland. But Sir Selwyn was inflexible in his determination
to see no doctor. Affectionate as his manner always was with Gaston,
he even showed impatience when pressed on this point; and Gaston,
forced to abandon it, fell back on his own skill in an endeavour to assign
some tangible cause for his father’s malady. But in this he was hopelessly
baffled.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nothing in Sir Selwyn’s present state, no circumstance of his past
history which was known to Gaston (who had rarely been apart from
him since boyhood), excused or explained in any degree the melancholy
which clouded his existence. His great fortune placed him beyond
suspicion or suggestion of pecuniary embarrassment. All the surroundings
of his home were well calculated to administer to the refined
pleasures of a man widely known as an amateur of books and art.
No entanglement of the affections could be supposed seriously to trouble
the peace of one who had passed his meridian, and who, moreover,
cherished still the memory of the wife he had long lost. He had friendships
which, while they attested his worth, would have been sufficient in
themselves to endear most men to life. Yet for months he had worn
the air of a man to whom life was fast becoming an unendurable
burden.</p>

<p class='c028'>His own skill and experience failing to open to Gaston any method
of coping with a disease whose hidden source and origin he could not
divine, he was on the point of writing to a leading London physician
of his acquaintance, when a circumstance occurred which saved him from
the necessity of this step.</p>

<p class='c028'>Sir Selwyn was alone in his room one evening when Gaston, who
was reading in a room immediately beneath, heard sounds overhead
which at once sent him upstairs to learn the cause. He had fancied
that his father was speaking in a tone of troubled remonstrance to some
unwelcome visitor, though he felt persuaded that no one, unless a
servant of the house, could be with him at that hour. Hastening to his
father’s room, his footsteps were arrested on the threshold by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>spectacle which the half-opened door revealed to him. Sir Selwyn
sat motionless and rigid in his chair; his face was colourless, and
all the features stiff, while the eyes, dilated and staring, seemed, though
they were fixed on space, to hold within their vision some object not
perceptible to Gaston. This was the more remarkable that Gaston
stood directly in his father’s line of sight, though it was certain that Sir
Selwyn neither looked at him nor saw him. In a word, it was the gaze
of a man who sees, or believes that he sees, an apparition.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston took a step forward; the sound fell on the baronet’s ear and
broke the spell which held him.</p>

<p class='c028'>His first look was one of inexpressible shame, succeeded immediately
by one of indescribable relief. If detection were painful, as it clearly
was, it appeared as though the pain were almost lost in the necessity
now forced upon him of disclosing the secret of his misery. Gaston was
at his father’s side in a moment.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is it, father?” he cried. “What is it? You have seen something.
Tell me what it is.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Sir Selwyn, in whose expression exhaustion and pain were mingled,
fixed his eyes for a while on his son’s face before he replied:</p>

<p class='c028'>“If I should tell you, Gaston, you would not believe it. I do not
believe it myself. And yet I see it, and know that it is there.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I shall believe whatever you tell me, father,” answered Gaston.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Gaston,” began the baronet, “you are a doctor, and have read,
read widely in all branches of science. Tell me, do you believe that we
who are in the body may see and know a spirit from the dead?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You believe, father, that you have seen such a spirit?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The whole force of my reason cannot persuade me otherwise,”
answered his father. “All the powers of my mind compel me to deny
it, and yet the thing is there before my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The baronet had by this time regained his usual calm of manner, and
his voice was resolute and quiet.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Is it here now, father?” asked Gaston.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” answered Sir Selwyn.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where, father? Point to me the place where it stands.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“It stands now at my elbow, side by side with you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston started involuntarily, the baronet’s tone bespoke such absolute
conviction. He moved a step, and placed himself immediately at his
father’s elbow.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you see it now, father?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, for you have taken its place. Yes! I see it again. It is on
this side now, exactly opposite to you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>There was in all this so little of the tone and manner of the mere
spectre-ridden visionary, that Gaston could not but be impressed, and
his alarm for his father’s state increased proportionately.</p>

<p class='c028'>He began to question him in the direct matter-of-fact style of a doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>with his patient, inquiring into the particular nature of the vision, how
often and in what circumstances it presented itself, whether his father
were able to connect it with any event of his life, or whether it seemed
to be causeless, a mere fabric of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c028'>His object in this was to bring his father to exert his reason upon the
matter, that so, if possible, he might end by convincing himself that he
was haunted merely by some spectre of the brain. He was, however,
only partially successful, and for this reason, that his father, while denying—and
with perfect honesty of convincement—the reality of his
vision, remained nevertheless persuaded that his bodily eye beheld it.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I cannot well remember,” went on Sir Selwyn, “how many years it
is since this spectre first began to haunt me. In the beginning I
thought little of it; my health was more robust then than it has been
in late years, and leading a more active life at that time than I am able
to do at present, I had greater strength, both of mind and body, to
assist me in banishing it from my thoughts and presence. Indeed, I
could then at any time rid myself of the vision by a mere exertion of
will; but I can do so no longer. It torments me now as it pleases. I am
powerless against it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Does the form resemble that of anyone whom you have ever
known?” asked Gaston.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” replied Sir Selwyn, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And the person whose spirit you believe this to be is now dead, father?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Dead many years,” answered Sir Selwyn.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And what is there in the vision that troubles you so greatly, father?”
asked his son.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Its presence is tormenting,” replied Sir Selwyn, “because I feel that
there is evil in it; it is malignant, and seems continually to threaten me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Is it here still, father?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, since we have been speaking it has vanished. I shall see it no
more to-night; but it will return to-morrow, and in the end it will kill
me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, father, no,” said Gaston affectionately, but gravely. “Let me
entreat you not to give way. You see how this vision, whatever it may
be, vanishes when you begin to reason upon it. The mere fact of our
having discussed it together will enable you to combat it more resolutely.
Do this, and the same power will revive by which you dispelled the
vision when first it troubled you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Indeed, the closing words of Sir Selwyn’s confession, notwithstanding
the quiet assurance with which they were spoken, had practically convinced
his son that the case was one of hallucination. They continued
talking on the subject until, at the baronet’s usual hour of retiring, they
separated for the night, when Gaston was so far satisfied that his arguments
appeared at last to have given his father a somewhat increased
measure of self-confidence.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>At breakfast the next day, Sir Selwyn assured his son that he had
slept well, and both in speech and look he was more cheerful than
Gaston had seen him during a considerable period. It seemed, in short,
as though the effect of their conversation the previous night had already
begun to bear out the son’s prediction; nor, at the end of a week, did
this good effect appear to have been in any degree dissipated. “I have
not seen it once,” said Sir Selwyn, in answer to a question from Gaston.
Another week passed, and a third, and the baronet declared that there
had been no recurrence of the visions. He became very reticent upon
the subject, and it was evident that he now shrank from any allusion to
it. Gaston, on his side, was only too willing to avoid its mention.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was at this time that Sir Selwyn received a letter from an old
friend of his college days, now holding a high place in the Indian
Government, reminding him of a long-promised visit, and begging him
to fulfil his word without further delay.</p>

<p class='c028'>A better invitation, thought Gaston, could not have arrived at a more
opportune moment. Their pleasant English home had become charged
for the baronet with associations which were wholly painful; a new
scene and fresher interests would assist to push to completion the recovery
which could not but be long delayed in his present situation. Sir
Selwyn himself was of the same mind, and decided at once to accept
his friend’s invitation.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then arose in Gaston’s mind the question whether, in the circumstances,
it were well or advisable that his father should make the
journey alone. He thought it not advisable at all, and without plainly
telling this to his father, begged that he might accompany him. But Sir
Selwyn showed a strong reluctance to accede to this request, which was
the more marked that father and son had never yet been separated on
any tour of pleasure. Gaston continued to press his point, until he
perceived, or thought that he perceived, what was his father’s reason for
wishing to take this journey alone.</p>

<p class='c028'>The thing which Sir Selwyn had striven for years to hide from his
son he had just been forced to reveal to him. It was the sorrowful
secret of his life, a secret which, to the baronet, had something of shame
in it, and the revelation had been beyond measure painful to him. If,
in one sense, the confession which had been wrung from him had
brought father and son more closely together, it had, in another sense,
placed a certain something between them of which the presence of
Gaston was a constant reminder. With Gaston at his father’s side, the
secret too was there. When Gaston’s delicate intuition had realised this
for him, his entreaties to accompany his father were at an end. It was
decided that Sir Selwyn should go to India alone, and in a fortnight
from the receipt of his friend’s invitation he was on his way.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston was desolate at home, and at the end of ten days or so he
went to Paris, intending to stay a week there and return to England;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>but the weather was pleasant, and from Paris he began to wander, in
<a id='corr67.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>leasurely</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_67.2'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>leasurely</ins></a></span> fashion, southwards; and before he had quite made up his
mind as to where he wanted to go, he found himself in Rome. Rome
was chilly, and he had lighted on a bad hotel, so he remained but a few
days, and went on to Naples. He would wait to see Rome, he said,
until his father was with him.</p>

<p class='c028'>After a fortnight in Naples, he was on the point of returning home,
when he received a cable message from his father, forwarded with letters
from England. Sir Selwyn had reached India safely and in good health,
and thought it probable that his stay would be of somewhat longer
duration than his arrangements on leaving England had contemplated.</p>

<p class='c028'>The prospect of five or six solitary months in the castle in Northumberland
had no relish for Gaston, so he resolved to extend his
tour by an excursion to Sicily. Accordingly, he took steamer one
evening from Naples to Palermo: the beautiful old city where the
traces yet linger of Saracen and Norman; with the tideless sea in front,
and the purple hills behind, and between the hills and the sea the little
lovely plain of the Shell of Gold. Naples is beautiful, but brutal; a
paradise peopled by savages: an Oriental languor softens the life of
Palermo, as it tinges with melancholy the national songs; and the rural
element which enters so largely into the character of the whole Sicilian
people makes them something of Arcadians in a modern Arcady.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston felt the charm of the place in an hour; the sense of want of
companionship which had gone with him in his listless wanderings in
Italy, here deserted him; he plucked ripe oranges in the garden of the
hotel, and they became his lotos fruit, for he resolved that his wanderings
should end in Palermo. He would remain here until his father
returned from India.</p>

<p class='c028'>But it chanced that there were few foreign visitors in Palermo that
season, and within a week of Gaston’s arrival the hotel at which he
stayed was emptied of all its guests, except himself and an old German
baron, and the baron waited only for a steamer to take him to Malta,
on his way to Egypt. An empty hotel in a foreign land is as cheerful
an abode as a catacomb, and Gaston cast about for a change of
quarters.</p>

<p class='c028'>Strolling one day in a slumbrous corner of the town, where cypress
trees stood sentinels at rusty iron gates, and the air smelled of lemon
groves and roses, he was struck by the aspect of a tenantless and
apparently deserted villa, walled within a garden, which, untended as
it was, retained a certain monastic trimness. A weather-stained board
over the iron gate, which was of fine workmanship, announced that the
villa was to let. Gaston tried the gate, but it was locked. A broad-hatted
priest who was passing at the moment, observing Gaston’s interest
in the villa, stopped, took a pinch of snuff, and said that if the signor
desired to have particulars of the place, he might obtain them from such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>a person in a street close at hand, which he indicated. Gaston thanked
the father for his courtesy, and went to inquire if he could see the villa,
with a view to hiring it for a short time.</p>

<p class='c028'>At dinner that evening, the baron said that he expected to sail for
Malta on the following day, and expressed his regret at leaving Gaston
alone in the hotel. Gaston replied that he should be sorry to lose the
companionship of the baron, but that he also was about to leave the
hotel, and had taken a villa for the remainder of his stay in Palermo.
He described the villa, and the baron, who spoke English well, exclaimed
with a laugh:</p>

<p class='c028'>“So! Is that the place? The Villa Torcello then has found a tenant
at last!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Has it been long without one?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Nearly thirty years.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And what is the reason?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How! Did they not tell you? The Villa Torcello is the famous
haunted house. Yes, I assure you, a real ghost! Are you not delighted?
You may be able to make a story about it, you know, you who write
novels.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And whose is the ghost?” inquired Gaston, whose associations with
this subject were by no means pleasant.</p>

<p class='c028'>“They ought to have told you about it,” answered the baron. “Some
people do not like ghosts. I do not like them myself, though to be sure
I have never seen a ghost. The house, as you know, is called the Villa
Torcello, but that was not its original name. Years ago it was called
the Villa Verga, after its first owner, Signor Udalrico Verga, a young
Sicilian of good family, who was well known and very popular in
Palermo. He lived there all alone, and was much visited by a priest, a
very handsome young man, a little older than himself, with whom he
was on terms of great affection. One morning, thirty years ago—I
believe it was in this very month—the gardener of the Signor Verga
found his master lying dead in the garden, with a bullet-hole in the
temple. There seemed no reason in the world why he should have
killed himself, and as no weapon was found near the body, or in any
part of the garden, it was concluded that he had been murdered. Suspicion
fell on the priest, though for no cause except that he had been
more intimate with the Signor Verga than anybody else. They were
never known to have had a quarrel, and as for evidence, not a scrap
could be produced against the priest, who, they say, showed the deepest
grief for his friend. Indeed he died, in great distress of mind, six months
afterwards. Some people, who would always regard him as the murderer,
said that remorse for his crime killed him; but though I have heard this
story many times since I first visited Palermo, I could never see that
there was any reason whatever to suspect the priest.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And the murder was never brought home to anyone?”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“It has remained a mystery from that day to this,” replied the baron.
“A year or two after the death of Verga, his brother went to live in
the Villa, changing its name to that of a property of his own in Calabria,
the name which it still bears. But he could not stay in it, for he said
that he saw the spirit of his brother walking in the garden in the
evenings, on the path where the body was found. Since he left it, the
house has never been occupied. As to the ghost, many stories are told,
but the favourite one is that it haunts the place seeking someone to avenge
the murder. That is a strange notion, don’t you think, Herr Fox?”</p>

<p class='c028'>The baron added no more to the story, and as he was busy with his
letters during the rest of the evening, Gaston only saw him again to bid
him good-bye on the following morning.</p>

<p class='c028'>A day or two afterwards, Gaston settled himself in the Villa <a id='corr69.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Torcello'>Torcello.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_69.13'><ins class='correction' title='Torcello'>Torcello.</ins></a></span>
His coming there created a momentary flutter of excitement in the
quarter where the villa was situated; but this was not known to Gaston,
who had neither friends nor acquaintances in the town.</p>

<p class='c028'>He wrote to tell his father of his new residence, and to ask him
whether he had visited Palermo in the tour he had made in Italy a few
years before Gaston’s birth. One morning, the post from England
brought him some flattering notices of a book he had published shortly
before leaving, which made him think that it was time to set to work
upon a new story. But the idea he was seeking did not come to him,
and the indolent charm of his surroundings favoured no severe exertion
of the intellect.</p>

<p class='c028'>He walked in the town until it grew familiar to him; its avenues, and
terraces by the sea, its deep shadowy gardens, its groves of orange trees
and lemon; its narrow streets and the multiplied variety of the houses,
with their odd and glaring contrasts of colour; its churches, where the
religion of the west seems out of harmony with the architectural and
decorative fashions of the east.</p>

<p class='c028'>Sometimes he hired a carriage and drove out into the country, and
these excursions were usually prolonged throughout the day. On one
such occasion, he was returning late in the afternoon, and the vetturino
was guiding his horses in lazy fashion in and out amongst a straggling
file of mule-carts laden with wine, in a narrow lane on the outskirts of
the town.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What place is this?” called out Gaston presently, pointing to an old,
discoloured building of considerable extent, which lay on the left of
the road.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Il Convento de’ Cappuccini, signor</i></span>,” replied the driver, and (never
rejecting a chance to rest) pulled up his horses, adding: “The signor
no see Il Convento? <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Ma, è molto curioso, signor</i></span> (but it’s a queer
place).”</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston got down from the carriage, and at that moment a sandalled
and brown-robed monk appeared at the entrance to the monastery.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Ecco il padre, signor!</i></span>” (There’s the father), said the driver, pointing
to the Capucin, who bowed to Gaston with a courteous indication of
readiness to receive him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston went across, and was presently following the monk through
an outer chamber of the monastery, empty and cold, with bare walls and
a dark stone floor.</p>

<p class='c028'>The monk stopped at a heavy wooden door, and taking a key from
his girdle, turned to Gaston and said, in a mixture of Italian and broken
English, which is here translated:</p>

<p class='c032'>“BUDDHISM IN CHRISTENDOM,
OR JESUS THE ESSENE,”
by Arthur Lillie, etc.—A queer and rather
thickish volume, of a presumably scientific
character, by an amateur Orientalist.
Contents:—Familiar theories, built on
two sacred and time-honoured names,
which the author enshrines between garlands
of modern gossip and libels on his
critics, past and present. A true literary
sarcophagus inhuming the decayed bodies
of very old, if occasionally correct, theories
jumbled up together with exploded speculations.</p>

<p class='c028'>The volume—title and symbology—is
pregnant with the atmosphere of the
sacred poetry attached to the names of
Gautama the Buddha, and “Jesus the
Essene.” To find it sprinkled with the
heavy drops of personal spite, is like
gazing at an unclean fly fallen into the
communion-wine of a chalice. One can
but wonder and ask oneself, what shall
be the next move in literature? Is it a
new “Sacred Book of the East,” in which
one will find the evidence by Policeman
Endacott against Miss Cass welcomed and
accepted as an historical fact? Or shall
it be the Pentecostal tongues of fire
examined in the light of the latest improved
kerosene lamp?</p>

<p class='c028'>But a well-informed chronicler at our
elbow reports that the author of <em>Buddhism
in Christendom, or Jesus the Essene</em>, is a
strong medium who sits daily for spiritual
development? This would account for
the wonderfully mixed character of the
contents of the volume referred to. It
must be so, since it reads just as such a
joint production would. It is a curious
mixture of “spirit” inspiration, passages
bodily taken from the reports of the
Society “for <em>Spookical</em> Research,” as
that misguided body was dubbed—for
once wittily—by the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>,
and various other little defamatory trifles
besides. The “spirit guides” are proverbially
revengeful and not always wise in their
generation. A former work by the same
medium having been three or four years
ago somewhat painfully mangled by a real
Sanskrit and Buddhist scholar in India,
the “Spirit Angel” falls foul now of his
critics. The wandering Spook tries to
run amuck among them, without even
perceiving the poor, good soul, that he
only blots and disfigures with the corrosive
venom of his spite the two noble
and sacred characters whom his medium-author
undertakes to interpret before ever
he has learned to understand them....</p>

<p class='c028'>This places “Lucifer” under the disagreeable
necessity of reviewing the pretentious
work at length in one of its future
numbers. As the same mistakes and
blunders occur in “Buddhism in Christendom”
as in “Buddha and Early Buddhism,”
the magazine must make it its
duty, if not altogether its pleasure, to
check the volume of 1883 by that of 1887.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is rumoured that “A CATECHISM
ON EVERY-DAY LIFE,” by a Theosophical
writer, is ready for press. Let
us hope it will contain no special theology
or dogmas, but only wise advice for practical
life, in its application to the ordinary
events in the existence of every theosophist.
The time has come when the veil
of illusion is to be pulled aside entirely,
not merely playfully, as hitherto done.
For if mere members of the theosophical
body have nothing to risk, except, perhaps,
an occasional friendly stare and
laugh at those who, without any special
necessity, as believed, pollute the immaculate
whiteness of their respectable society
skirts by joining an unpopular movement,
real theosophists ought to look truth and
fact right in the face. To become a true
theosophist—<i>i.e.</i> one thoroughly imbued
with altruistic feelings, with a willingness
to forget self, and readiness to help his
neighbour to carry the burden of life—is to
become instantaneously transformed into
a public target. It is to make oneself a
ready thing for heavy “Mrs. Grundy” to
sit upon: to become the object of ridicule,
slander, and vilification, which will
not stop even before an occasional criminal
charge. For some theosophists, every
move in the <em>true theosophical direction</em>, is
a forlorn-hope enterprise. All this notwithstanding,
the ranks of the “unpopular”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>society are steadily, if slowly increasing.</p>

<p class='c028'>For what does slander and ridicule
really matter? When have fools ever
been slandered, or rich and influential
men and women ostracised, however
black and soiled in their hearts, or in
their secret lives? Who ever heard of a
Reformer’s or an orator’s course of life
running smooth? Who of them escaped
from being pelted with dirt by his
enemies?</p>

<p class='c028'>Gautama Buddha, the great Hindu
Reformer, was charged by the Brahmins
with being a demon, whose form was
taken by Vishnu, to encourage men to
despise the Vedas, deny the gods, and
thus effect their own destruction.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>“THE LATEST ROMANCE OF SCIENCE,” Summarized by a Frenchman.</h3>

<p class='c035'>If the Atomo-mechanical Theory of the
Universe has caused considerable embarrassment
to our materialists, and
brought some of their much beloved
scientific speculations to grief (see “Concepts
of Modern Physics,” by Stallo), the
layman must not be ungrateful to the
great men for other boons received at
their hands. Through the indefatigable
labours of the most famous biologists and
anthropologists of the day, the mystery
which has hitherto enshrouded the origin
of man is no more. It has vanished into
thin air; thanks to the activity of the
<em>officina</em> (workshop, in Queen’s English),
in Haeckel’s brain, or, as a Hylo-Idealist
would say, in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vesiculo neurine
of his hemispherical ganglia</i></span><a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—the origin
of mankind has to be sought in <em>that</em>
scientific region, and nowhere else.</p>

<p class='c028'>Religiously read by the “Animalists”
in its English translation in Protestant
and Monarchical England, the “Pedigree
of Man” is now welcomed with shouts
of joy in Roman Catholic Republican
France. A summary has just been compiled
of it by a French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>savant</i></span>, who rejoices
in the name of Topinard. The
summary on that “question of questions”
(as Mr. Huxley calls it), is more interesting
in reality than the “Pedigree of
Man” itself. It is so deliciously fantastic
and original, that one comes almost to
regret that our numerous and frolicsome
ancestors in the Zoological Gardens of
Europe and America seem to show no intention
of getting up a subscription list
among themselves, for the raising of a
lasting monument to the great Haeckel.
Thus, ingratitude in man must surely be
a phenomenon of <em>atavism</em>; another suggestive
point being thus gained toward
further proof of man’s descent from the
ingrate and heartless, as well as tailless,
pithecoid baboon.</p>

<p class='c028'>Saith the learned Topinard:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“At the commencement of what geologists call
the <em>Laurentian period</em> of the Earth, and the fortuitous
union of certain elements of carbon,
oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, under conditions
which <em>probably</em> only took place at that
epoch, the first albuminoid clots were formed.
From them, and by spontaneous generation,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
the first cellules or cleavage masses took their
origin. These cellules were then sub-divided
and multiplied, arranging themselves in the form
of organs, and after a series of transformations,
fixed by Mr. Haeckel at nine in number, originated
certain vertebrata of the genus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Amphioxus
lanceolatus</i></span>. The division into sexes was marked
out, the spinal marrow and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>chorda dorsalis</i></span>
became visible. At the tenth stage the brain and
skull made their appearance, as in the lamprey;
at the eleventh, the limbs and jaws were developed ...
the earth was then
only in the <em>Silurian</em> period. At the sixteenth, the
adaptation to terrestrial life ceased. At the seventeenth,
which corresponds to the <em>Jurassic</em> phase
of the history of the globe, the genealogy of man is
raised to the kangaroo among the marsupials.
At the eighteenth, he becomes a lemurian; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><em>Tertiary period</em> commences. At the nineteenth,
he becomes Catarrhinian, that is to say, an ape
with a tail, a Pithecian. At the twentieth he
becomes an anthropoid, continuing so throughout
the whole of the <em>Miocene period</em>. At the twenty-first
he becomes a man-ape, he does not possess language,
nor in consequence the corresponding brain.
Lastly, at the twenty-second, man comes forth ...
in his inferior types.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Happy, privileged man! Hapless evolution-forsaken
baboon! We are not told
by science the secret why, while man has
had plenty of time to become, say a Plato,
a Newton, a Napoleon, or <em>even</em> a Haeckel,
his poor ancestor should have been
arrested in his growth and development.
For, as far as is known, the rump of the
cynocephalus seems as blue and as callous
to-day, as it was during the reign of
Psammetichus or Cheops; the macacus
must have made as ugly faces at Pliny 18
centuries back, as he does now at a Darwinian.
We may be told that in the enormous
period of time that must have
elapsed since the beginning of evolution,
2,000, or even 10,000, years mean very
little. But then, one does not find even
the Moneron any better off for the millions
of years that have rolled away. Yet,
between the gelatinous and thoughtful
hermit of the briny deep and man, there
must have elapsed quite sufficient time
for some trifling transformation. That
primordial protoplasmic creature, however,
seems to fare no better at the hands
of evolution, which has well-nigh forgotten
it.</p>

<p class='c028'>By this time, one would suppose that
this ancestor of ours of stage <em>one</em>, ought to
have reached, to say the least, a higher
development: to have become, for instance,
the amphibian “sozura” of the “fourteenth
stage,” so minutely and scientifically described
by Mr. Haeckel, and of which De Quatrefages
so wickedly says in “The Human
Species” (p. 108), that “it (the sozura) is
<em>equally unknown to science</em>.” But we see
quite the reverse. This tender-bodied little
one, has remained but a moneron to this
very hour: so much so, that Mr. Huxley,
fishing him out from the abysmal ocean
depths, took pity upon him, and gave
him a father. He baptized our archaic
ancestor, and named him <em>Bathybius
Haeckelii</em>....</p>

<p class='c028'>But all these are mysteries that will, no
doubt, be easily explained to the full satisfaction—of
science, by any biologist of
Haeckel’s brain power. As all know, no
acrobatic feats, from the top of one tree
to another top, by the swiftest of chimpanzees,
can ever approach, let alone
equal, the rapid evolutions of fancy in his
cerebral “officina,” whenever Haeckel is
called upon to explain the inexplicable....</p>

<p class='c028'>There is one trifle, however, which
seems to have the best of even his
capacity for getting out of a scientific
dilemma, and this is <em>the eighteenth stage</em>
of his genealogy, in the “Pedigree of
Man.” Man’s evolution from the Monera,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>alias</i></span> Bathybius <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Haeckelii</i></span>, up to tailed
and then tailless man, passes through the
marsupials, the kangaroo, sarrigue, etc.
Thus he writes:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“<em>Eighteenth stage.</em> Prosimiæ allied to
the Loris (Stenops) and Makis (Lemur),
without marsupial bones, but <em>with
placenta</em>.” (“<cite>Pedig. of Man.</cite>” p. 77.)</p>

<p class='c028'>Now it may be perhaps interesting to
the profane and the innocent to learn that
no such “prosimiæ,” with placenta, exists in
nature. That it is, in short, another
creation of the famous German Evolutionist,
and a child of his own brain. For
De Quatrefages has pointed out several
years ago, that:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The anatomical investigations of MM.
Alphonse Milne, Edwards and Grandidier ...
place it beyond all doubt that the prosimiæ of
Haeckel have <em>no decidua and a diffuse placenta</em>.
They are <em>indeciduata</em>. Far from <em>any possibility
of their being the ancestors of the apes</em>, according
to the principles laid down by Haeckel himself,
they cannot even be regarded as the ancestors of
the zonoplacential mammals ... and ought
to be connected with the pachydermata, the
edentata and the cetacea.” (p. 110.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>But, as that great French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>savant</i></span> shows,
“Haeckel, without the least hesitation,
adds his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prosimiæ</i></span>,” to the other groups
in the “Pedigree of Man,” and “attributes
to them ... a discoidal placenta.”
Must the world of the too
credulous innocents again accept on faith
these two creatures unknown to Science or
man, only because “the proof of their
existence arises <em>from the necessity of an
intermediate type</em>?” This necessity, however
being one only for the greater success
of their inventor, Haeckel, that Simian
Homer must not bear us ill will, if we do
not hesitate to call his “genealogy” of
man a romance of Science of the wildest
type.</p>

<p class='c028'>One thing is very suggestive in this
speculation. The discovery of the absence
of the needed placenta in the so-called
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prosimiæ</i></span> now dates several years back.
Haeckel knows of it, of course. So does
Mr. Ed. B. Aveling, D.Sc., his translator.
Why is the error allowed to remain uncorrected,
and even unnoticed, in the
English translation of the “Pedigree of
Man,” of 1887? Do the “members of the
International Library of Science and Free-thought,”
fear to lose some of Haeckel’s
admirers were these to learn the truth?</p>

<p class='c028'>Nevertheless Haeckel’s scientific “Pedigree
of Man,” ought to awake and stir up
to action the spirit of private enterprise.
What a charming <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Féerie</i></span> could be made
of it on the stage of a theatre! A <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>corps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>de ballet</i></span>, composed of antediluvian reptiles
and giant lizards, gradually, and stage by
stage, metamorphosing themselves into
kangaroos, lemurs, tailless apes and anthropoid
baboons, and finally into a chorus
of German biologists!</p>

<p class='c028'>Such a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Féerie</i></span> would leave “Black
Crook,” and “Alice in Wonder-Land,”
nowhere. An intelligent manager, alive to
his interests, would make his fortune were
he but to follow the happy thought.</p>

<p class='c040'>THE BOOK OF LIFE, by Sidhartha
(also) Vonisa; his discoveries from “6215
to 6240, Anno Mundi.”</p>

<p class='c028'>A cross between an <em>octavo</em> and <em>duodecimo</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>This volume, we see, is highly appreciated
by the clergy, by whom, at this
gloomy day of infidelity, even small
favours seem to be thankfully received.
The author (profane name unknown)
hints, when he does not state plainly, that
he is a reincarnation of Gautama Buddha,
or Siddartha, as also of a few other no
meaner historical personages. The work
is a clever steering between the sandbanks
of science and theology. Enough
is given in careful agreement with the
former to make it ignore the more abundant
concessions to the gods of the latter—<i>e.g.</i>,
Biblical chronology. The age of
the world is allowed 6240 years from
Adam, “seven hundred years after the
brown and black races had been created”
(p. 53 “Chronology”); the date of the
earth’s incrustation and globe being left to
the imagination of the reader. A chronological
table of the principal historical
events of the world is published on pages
53-56. Among them the birth of Moses
is placed 1572 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The Vedas are
shown compiled in India, and the poems
of Homer in Greece, “about 1200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>”
Siddartha or Gautama established Buddhism
in India “from 808 to 726,” <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> we are
told. Last, but not least, of the world
epochs and <em>divine</em> signs of the time,
comes the for ever memorable event of
March 31st, 1885—namely, the “Book of
Life, Vonisa, was completely written,”
and it closes the list. The reader is notified,
moreover, at the line beginning with
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 6240, that the year 1884 <span class='fss'>C.E.</span> (Christian
Era) is the “beginning of Messianic
age and close of Christian age,” which
might account for the appearance and
publication in the year following of the
original volume now under review.</p>

<p class='c028'>The new Messiah declares that “although
much of the work consists of discoveries
which are original with the
author, yet the reader will find in the
Analytic Index a few hundred out of the
many references which might be given to
eminent authorities which were consulted
in its preparation.” Among these, it
seems, one has to include some theosophic
writings, as it is stated in the
“Book of Life” that—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>(<i>a.</i>) “Seven great forces were concerned in
these vast movements of early creation.”</p>

<p class='c028'>(<i>b.</i>) “Seven Ages of the Earth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>(<i>c.</i>) “Vayomer Elohim” translated “according
to the laws of the Hebrew language,” means
that “seven forces were used as three-fold
factors,” and</p>

<p class='c028'>(<i>d.</i>) <a id='corr74R.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='That'>“That</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_74R.15'><ins class='correction' title='That'>“That</ins></a></span> the first human beings were incarnated
spirits” (pp. 26-27).</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The above four declarations have the
approval of theosophy. Whether the sentence
that follows, namely, that “the work
of incarnation (of the <em>spirits</em>) took place
according to law,” and is “the clearest
hypothesis <em>which science has to offer concerning
the origin of man</em>,” will meet with
the same approval from Messrs. Huxley,
Haeckel, and Fiske, of the “Atomo-mechanical
Theory,” is very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nor is it so sure that the Ethnological
department in the Anglo-Indian Bureau
of Statistics is quite prepared to alter its
census returns in accordance with Siddartha’s
declaration, on page 29,that—</p>

<p class='c028'>“One branch of the brown race was
the Dravidian, <em>which still holds its place
in Northern India</em>.” (?!)</p>

<p class='c028'>A new book, bearing the title of
SPIRIT REVEALED, is nearly ready
for press. It is described as an extraordinary
work. Its author is Wm. C.
Eldon Serjeant, F.T.S., a writer of
articles on the “Coming Reformation,”
“Sparks from the World of Fire,” &amp;c., &amp;c.
The work claims to “explain the Nature
of the Deity, and to discuss His manifestations
on every plane of existence, and
to show forth the form of Christ, whose
second coming is expected by Christians,
and to proclaim the advent of the Messiah
according to the belief of the Jews.” “Many
subjects, involving questions of considerable
obscurity in reference to the Deity,
to the Scriptures, to men, to animals, and
to things generally, are comprehensively
treated and explained in accordance with
the Word of the Spirit declared at various
times through the sons of men.”</p>

<p class='c041'>These reports coming out <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad libitum</i></span>, without
any definite date, cannot be regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>periodical. Depending for their circulation
chiefly on the consummation of what
the learned editors offer as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bonâ fide</i></span>
psychic and spiritualistic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>exposés</i></span>—which
the public accepts as most kind advertisements
of the people so attacked—this
publication occupies a position entirely
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span>. The “Proceedings”
offer to the public a very useful <em>manual</em>,
something between a text and a guidebook,
with practical instructions in diplomatic
policy in the domain of the
Psychic, in the form of scientific letters
and private detective information. Sensitives
discern in the “Proceedings” (by
<em>telepathic impact</em>) the Machiavelian spirit
of aristocratic Bismarck, seasoned with
an aura strongly impregnated with the
plebeian perfumes of honest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mouchards</i></span> on
duty, but then they are, perhaps, prejudiced.
On the other hand, some
Russian spiritualistically inclined members
of the S.P.R. have been heard
to say, that the “Proceedings” reminded
them of those of the happily defunct
Third Section of the St. Petersburg
Police. Thus, the tutelary “guides” of
the learned association of the British
Psychists, may one day turn out to be the
departed spirits of Russian <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gendarmes</i></span>
after all?</p>

<p class='c028'>Occasionally when the hunting grounds
of this erudite body have afforded a
specially successful chase—after mares’
nests—a <cite>Supplement</cite> is added to the
“Proceedings,” the magnitude of the
added volume being in inverse ratio to
the illumination of its contents, which
are generally offered as a premium to
materialism.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hence, the “Proceedings” may be better
described as the fluctuating and occasional
records of a society bent upon
giving the lie to its own name. For
“Psychical” research is surely a misnomer,
besides being a delusion and a
snare for the unwary. <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> would
suggest as a truer title, “Society
for Hylo-<i>Pseumatical</i> Research.” This
would give the S.P.R. the benefit of an
open connection with Dr. Lewins’ unparalleled
“Hylo-Idealism”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a>—while it
would enable it to sail under its <em>true</em>
colours.</p>

<p class='c028'>Whether <span class='sc'>Lucifer’s</span> advice be accepted
or not, the profound philosophy of
the phenomenon baptized “telepathy”
and telepathic impact can only be studied
scientifically, in our spasmodic contemporary.
This new Greek stranger is the
crowning work of the Psychic Fathers
of our century. It is their “first” and
“only” offspring, and is a <em>genuine</em> discovery
as far as its Hellenic name goes.
For, bereft of its Greek appellation, it
becomes like America. The genius who
<em>discovered</em> the phenomenon, is like
Columbus on whom the Northmen, and
even the Chinamen, had stolen a march
centuries before. This phenomenon can
only seem <em>new</em> when thus disguised
under a name solemn and scientific—because
incomprehensible to the average
profane. Its plain description in English—as
transference of thought or sensation
from a distance—could never hope to have
the same ring of classical learning in it.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nevertheless, the “Proceedings” with
the two additional gigantic volumes of
the psychic “Leviathan,” called “Phantasms
of the Living,” are strongly recommended
to invalids. They are priceless
in cases of obstinate <em>insomnia</em>, as the best
soporific known. <em>Directions</em>: The reader
must be careful not to light a match in
too close proximity to the said works.</p>

    <div class='c000'><i>To the Editor of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>We are told that, before judging a
horary figure, we must ascertain if it is
radical, and to decide this point several
rules have been given. The first is with
regard to the number of degrees on the
cusp of the ascendant. Lilly says a
figure is rarely radical if the first two or
last three degrees of a sign ascend.
Morrison fixes the limit at the first or
second and last two degrees. Pearse
gives the limit as the first and last five
degrees, and Raphael as the first and last
three.</p>

<p class='c028'>All the laws of nature are harmonious
and rational; but in the rule of the first
two authorities, this harmony seems
absent. Why should the limit be 1 or 2
degrees at the beginning of the sign and
2 or 3 at the end?</p>

<p class='c028'>Again, as an exception to the above
rule, Lilly says that a figure may be
radical even when 27° or more ascend, if
the number corresponds to his age; and
when 1° or 2° ascend, if the querent be very
young, and his appearance agrees with
the quality of the signs ascending. And
here again there is the same want of
harmony. Why should the age of the
querent have to correspond accurately
in one case and only approximately in
the other? Furthermore, no astrologers
seem to have given a logical explanation
of these rules.</p>

<p class='c028'>On reflecting on this problem I reasoned
thus. In ♍ 29° 59´ 59´´ ♃ is absolutely
without dignity; in ♐ 0° 0´ 1´´ he is in his
house triplicity, and terms, a threefold
dignity. Is it conceivable that this great
change of power should be so sudden, as
to be accomplished in less than 2 seconds
of space? Analogy shows that it is probably
otherwise, and that as the planets
and cusps of houses have orbs of influence,
<em>so also have the signs</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>If this be true, it supplies the key to the
above problem. If only the first or last
few degrees of a sign ascend, then the
cusp of the ascendant is within the orbs
of the adjacent signs, and the house is
not ruled solely by the planet which is
its proper lord, but also partly by the
planet ruling the adjacent sign; and this
must hold good under all circumstances,
even when the number of the degrees
ascending agree with the age of the
querent, or the ascending sign and
planets therein describe him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Furthermore, if this be admitted, it also
follows, as a logical conclusion, that if the
first and last few degrees of a sign are on
the cusp of any house, no conclusion can
be drawn with certainty from the aspects
of the lord of that house.</p>

<p class='c028'>The exact limits of the orbs of the
signs must be decided by experience; I
am induced to fix the limits at 2° 30´ and
27° 30´.</p>

<p class='c028'>The belief in the power and efficacy of
talismans and amulets was, at one period
of the world’s history, universal. Even
during the XVth century, the latest among
the innumerable revivals of civilisation,
the majority of learned and cultured men
had a profound conviction of their reality.
But such ideas are now scouted by popular
opinion, because the philosophy underlying
them is not understood. <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>,
therefore, would certainly confer a boon
on many by throwing light on the following
points:—</p>

<p class='c028'>(1). Wherein does the power of a talisman
lie? (2). How far does its efficacy
depend on the signs traced upon it, and
how far on the power and knowledge of
the maker? (3). Granting that will-power
and knowledge are the main factors in
imparting to the talisman its power, how
does that power remain attached to it
after the death of the man who made it.</p>

<p class='c032'>The Theosophist, a magazine of
Oriental Philosophy, Art, Literature, and
Occultism. Conducted by H. P. Blavatsky,
and H. S. Olcott, Permanent President of
the T. S. Vol. VIII., Nos. 94 and 95, July
and August, 1887. Madras, India. In
London, George Redway, 15, York Street,
Covent Garden.</p>

<p class='c028'>This journal is the oldest of the periodicals
of the Theosophical Society, and has
a distinct feature of its own: a number of
Hindoo, Buddhist, and Parsi contributors
among the most learned of British India.
No journal is thus more reliable in the
occasional information given in it upon
the sacred tenets and scriptures of the
East, since it is derived first hand, and
comes from native scholars, well versed
in their respective cults. From time to
time <cite>The Theosophist</cite> has respectfully
corrected mistakes—sins of omission and
commission—by Western Orientalists, and
will continue to perform its proposed
task by issuing admirable articles.</p>

<p class='c028'>As a marked instance of this, the four
“Lectures on the Bhagavid Gita,” by a
native scholar, Mr. T. Subba Rao, may
be cited. Begun in the February number,
they are now concluded in the July issue.
No better, abler, or more complete exposition
on that most philosophical, as
the least understood, of the sacred books
of the East, has ever been given in any
work, past or present. In the June and
July numbers, the “Ha-Khoshe-Cah, a
Vision of the Infinite,” by Dr. Henry
Pratt, a erudite Kabalist in England, is
published.</p>

<p class='c028'>Some very interesting articles on the
“Norse Mythology,” by the learned
Swedish scholar, Mr. C. H. A. Bjerregard
(the Astor Library, New York), may also
be found in the last numbers.</p>

<p class='c028'><cite>The Theosophist</cite> is the journal of the
Theosophical Society <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>; the
Minutes and records of the Society’s work,
being given monthly in its “Supplements.”</p>

<p class='c028'>No evil wisher of the said Society, rushing
into publicity with denunciations, and
occasionally libellous attacks upon that
body, ought—if he is a fair-minded and
<em>honest</em> opponent, of course—to publish
anything without first making himself well
acquainted with the contents of <cite>The Theosophist</cite>,
and especially with the <cite>Supplements</cite>
attached to that journal.</p>

<p class='c028'>This advice is given in all kindness to
our traducers—the learned as the ignorant—for
their direct benefit, though at an
evident disadvantage to theosophy. For,
as so many of our critics have been lately
making fools of themselves, in their alleged
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>exposés</i></span> of our doctrines, it is to the
advantage of our Society to let them go
on undisturbed, and thus turn the laugh
on the enemy. Two graphic instances
may be cited. In “Buddhism in Christendom;
or, Jesus the Essene,” by an impolite
dabbler in Orientalism, the septenary
doctrine of the Occultists is disfigured
out of recognition, and is met
by the unanimous hearty laugh of those
who know something of the subject.
Its unlucky author has evidently never
opened a serious theosophical work,
unless, indeed, the doctrine is too much
above his head. As a refreshing contrast
one finds, in “Earth and Its Earliest
Ages,” by G. H. Pember, an author, who
has most conscientiously studied and
understood the fundamental doctrines of
Theosophy.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus, notwithstanding his attempt to
connect it with the coming Antichrist,
and show its numerous writers pledged to
the work of Satan, “the Prince of the
Powers of the Air,”<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the volume published
by that learned and fair-minded gentleman
is a true pearl in the <em>anti</em>-Theosophical
literature. The correct enunciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of knowledge of the tenets he disapproves,
as a sincere orthodox Christian, is remarkable;
and his language, dignified, polite,
and entirely free from any personality
can but call forth as courteous a reply
from those he arraigns. He has evidently
read, and, what is more, <em>understood</em>,
what he found in the <cite>Theosophist</cite>,
and other mystic volumes. It shall,
therefore, be the pleasure and duty of
<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, who bears no malice for the
personal attack, to review this interesting
volume in its October issue, hoping to
see as kind a notice of “Earth and Its
Earliest Ages” in the <cite>Theosophist</cite> of
Madras.</p>

<p class='c028'>A most excellent and theosophical
monthly, full of philosophical literature
by several well-known mystics and
writers. The best publication of its kind
in the United States, and one that ever
fulfils what it promises, giving more food
for thought than many of the larger periodicals.
Its August number is very
interesting and fully up to its usual
mark.</p>

<p class='c028'>Jasper Niemann continues his excellent
reflections in “Letters on the True.”
Mr. E. D. Walker, in an article upon
“The Poetry of Reincarnation in
Western Literature,” cites the verses of
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Dean Alford,
Addison, H. Vaughan, Browning, etc., in
proof of the fact that these poets were
tinctured, if not imbued, with the philosophy
of reincarnation. B. N. Acle
continues <cite>Notes on the Astral Light</cite>, from
Eliphas Levi. He cites the startling and
lurid enunciation of that epigrammatical
occultist, who says that “He who dies
without forgiving his enemy, hurls himself
into Eternity armed with a dagger, and
devotes himself to the horror of eternal
murder.” “<cite>The Symbolism of the Equilateral
Triangle</cite>,” by Miss Lydia Bell,
shows how much wisdom can be extracted
from a little symbol when you know how
to look for it there.</p>

<p class='c028'>S. B. makes some very pertinent remarks
upon <cite>Theosophical Fiction</cite>, the
growth of which is one sign of the times.
“A true picture of life, either real or potential,
which is found in a work of fiction,
makes such reading one of the best
sources of learning.” Thanks to the
education which it is receiving from the
more solid literature of theosophy, the
public is becoming more critical, and
has already formed a “standard of probability”
for marvellous phenomena, which
acts as a healthy check upon outside
writers of fiction, who are therefore no
longer able to trust entirely “to their
imagination for their acts, and to their
memory for their fancies.” Novel readers
now like their supernatural not to be <em>unnaturally</em>
supernatural, even if they do
have to take it in minute doses, disguised
in their favourite draught of love, murder
and small talk. <cite>The Higher Carelessness</cite>
(No. 7 of <cite>Thoughts in Solitude</cite>), by
“Pilgrim,” is full of deep and beautiful
reflections. This writer, like “American
Mystic” whose article on the puzzling
question, “<cite>Am I my Brothers Keeper</cite>,”
comes next, has advanced some way upon
the path of knowledge, and the thoughts
of both of them have a special interest
for contemplative and self-examining
readers. “American Mystic,” by-the-bye,
gives a new and striking turn to a phrase
too often misunderstood. “Resist not
evil” he quotes and explains that resistance,
fierce and personal, to evil befalling
oneself, is what is meant. <cite>Christianity—Theosophy</cite>,
by Mr. Wm. H. Kembal, seeks
to show that the fundamental aim of both,
namely the Brotherhood of Humanity, is
the same, and that they can and ought to
unite their forces.</p>

“Buddha’s Teaching,” the second on “The
Relations of the Lower and Higher Self.”
Dealing with Buddhism, Mr. Sinnett exposes
several of the current misconceptions

Notably among these stand the utterly
false ideas, current in the West, that
Buddha recognised no conscious existence
for the individual after death, and that
Nervana is synonymous with annihilation.
Mr. Sinnett draws a happy comparison
between these misconceptions and
the strange blindness shown by European
scholars in accepting the allegorical
legend that Buddha’s death was occasioned
by eating roast <em>boar</em>, as a literal
fact.</p>

<p class='c028'>In his second paper, Mr. Sinnett follows
up a line of thought originated by
him in an earlier number of the “Transactions.”

<h4 class='c023'>THE ESOTERIC VALUE OF CERTAIN WORDS AND DEEDS IN SOCIAL LIFE.</h4>

<p class='c032'>A definition of <em>Public Opinion</em>. The

who act on the many noodles negatively
electrified by indifference. The acceptation
of uncharitable views on “suggestion”
by “telepathic impact” (what ever

psychology.</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Sympathetic grief.</em>—The expression
thereof in Society, for one’s sorrow, is like
a solemn funeral procession, in which the
row of mourning coaches is long, indeed,
but the carriages of which are all empty.</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Mutual exchange of compliments.</em>—Expressions
of delight and other acting in
cultured society are the fig-leaves of the
civilised Adams and Eves. These “aprons”
to conceal truth are fabricated incessantly
in social Edens, and their name is—<em>politeness</em>.</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Keeping the Sabbath.</em>—Throwing
public contumely on, and parading one’s
superiority over Christ, “one greater
than the temple” and Sabbath, who stood
for his disciples’ rights to “break” the
Sabbath, for the Sabbath was made for
man, and not man for Sabbath (Matt. xii.
and Mark ii., etc.).</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Attending Divine Service.</em>—Breaking
the express commandment of Jesus.
Becoming “as the hypocrites are,” who
love to pray in Synagogue and Temples,
“that they may be seen of men.” (Matt.vi.)</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Taking the Oath, on the Bible.</em>—A
Christian law, devised and adopted to
perpetuate and carry out the unequivocal
commandment of the Founder of
Christianity, “Swear not at all, neither
by heaven nor by the earth” (Matt. v.). As
the heaven and the earth are supposed to
have been created <em>only</em> by God, a book
written by <em>men</em> thus received the prerogative
over the former.</p>

<p class='c035'><em>Unpopularity.</em>—We hate but those
whom we envy or fear. Hatred is a concealed
and forced homage rendered to the
person hated; a tacit admission of the
superiority of the unpopular character.</p>

<p class='c035'>The true value of <em>back-biting and

triumph of the victim chosen. The bite
of the fly when the creature feels its end
approaching.</p>

encouraging the worship of the said seven spirits of the stars. “One cannot exalt too

easily, the verb <em>hillel</em> may be made to mean “to howl,” hence, by an easy derivation, hillel may be
constructed into “howler,” or a devil, a creature, however, one hears rarely, if ever, “howling.” In

  <h3 class='c011'>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>It is intensely interesting to follow season after season the rapid
evolution and change of public thought in the direction of the
mystical. The educated mind is most undeniably attempting
to free itself from the heavy fetters of materialism. The ugly caterpillar
is writhing in the agonies of death, under the powerful efforts of
the psychic butterfly to escape from its science-built prison, and every
day brings some new glad tidings of one or more such mental births to
light.</p>

<p class='c028'>As the New York “Path” truly remarks in its September issue, when
“Theosophical and kindred topics ... are made the texts for novels,”
and, we may add, scientific essays and <em>brochures</em>, “the implication is that
interest in them has become diffused through all social ranks.” That kind
of literature is “paradoxically proof that Occultism has passed beyond
the region of careless amusement and entered that of serious enquiry.”
The reader has but to throw a retrospective glance at the publications
of the last few years to find that such topics as Mysticism, Magic,
Sorcery, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Mesmerism, or, as it is now called,
Hypnotism, all the various branches in short of the <em>Occult</em> side of nature,
are becoming predominant in every kind of literature. They visibly increase
in proportion to the efforts made to discredit the movements in
the cause of truth, and strangle enquiry—whether on the field of theosophy
or spiritualism—by trying to besmear their most prominent heralds,
pioneers and defenders, with tar and feathers.</p>

<p class='c028'>The key-note for mystic and theosophic literature was Marion Crawford’s
“Mr. Isaacs.” It was followed by his “Zoroaster.” Then followed
“The Romance of Two Worlds,” by Marie Corelli; R. Louis Stephenson’s
“Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll;” “The Fallen Idol,” by Anstey; “King
Solomon’s Mines” and the thrice famous “She,” by Rider Haggard;
“Affinities” and “The Brother of the Shadow,” by Mrs. Campbell
Praed; Edmund Downey’s “House of Tears,” and many others less
noticeable. And now there comes a fresh outburst in Florence Marryat’s
“Daughter of the Tropics,” and F. C. Philips’ “Strange Adventures
of Lucy Smith.” It is unnecessary to mention in detail the literature
produced by avowed theosophists and occultists, some of whose works
are very remarkable, while others are positively scientific, such as S. L.
Macgregor Mathers’ “Kabbalah Unveiled,” and Dr. F. Hartmann’s
“Paracelsus,” “Magic, White and Black,” &amp;c. We have also to note
the fact that theosophy has now crossed the Channel, and is making
its way into French literature. “La France” publishes a strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>romance by Ch. Chincholle, pregnant with theosophy, occultism and
mesmerism, and called “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Grande Pretresse</cite></span>,” while <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Revue politique
et litteraire</cite></span> (19 Feb. 1887, <i>et seq.</i>) contained over the signature of
Th. Bentzon, a novel called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Emancipée</cite></span>, wherein esoteric doctrines
and adepts are mentioned in conjunction with the names of well-known
theosophists. A sign of the times!</p>

<p class='c028'>Literature—especially in countries free from government censorship—is
the public heart and pulse. Besides the glaring fact that were there
no demand there would be no supply, current literature is produced
only to please, and is therefore evidently the mirror which faithfully
reflects the state of the public mind. True, Conservative editors, and
their submissive correspondents and reporters, still go on slashing
occasionally in print the fair faces of mystic spiritualism and theosophy,
and some of them are still found, from time to time, indulging
in a <em>brutal</em> personal attack. But they do no harm on the whole, except
perhaps to their own editorial reputations, as such editors can never
be suspected of an exuberance of culture and good taste after certain
ungentlemanly personal attacks. They do good on the contrary.
For, while the theosophists and spiritualists so attacked, may view the
Billingsgate poured upon them in a true Socratean spirit, and console
themselves with the knowledge that none of the epithets used can possibly
apply to them, on the other hand, <em>too much</em> abuse and vilification generally
ends by awakening the public sympathy for the victim, in the right-minded
and the impartial, at any rate.</p>

<p class='c028'>In England people seem to like fair play on the whole. It is not <em>bashi-boozook</em>-like
actions, the doughty deeds of those who delight in mutilating
the slain and the wounded, that can find sympathy for any great length
of time with the public. If—as maintained by our lay enemies and repeated
by some <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>naïf</i></span> and too sanguine missionary organs—Spiritualism
and Theosophy are “dead as a door-nail” (<em>sic</em>, <em>vide</em> American Christian
periodicals),—aye, “dead and buried,” why, in such case, good Christian
fathers, not leave the dead at rest till “Judgment Day”? And if they are
not, then editors—the profane as well as the clerical—why should you still
fear? Do not show yourselves such cowards if you have the truth on your
side. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Magna est veritas et prevalebit</i></span>, and “murder will out,” as it always
has, sooner or later. Open your columns to <em>free</em> and fearless discussion,
and do as the theosophical periodicals have ever done, and as <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> is
now preparing to do. The “bright Son of the morning” fears no light.
He courts it, and is prepared to publish any inimical contributions
(couched, of course, in decent language), however much at variance with
his <a id='corr84.41'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='theosopical'>theosophical</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_84.41'><ins class='correction' title='theosopical'>theosophical</ins></a></span> views. He is determined to give a fair hearing in any
and every case, to both contending parties and allow things and thoughts
to be judged on their respective merits. For why, or what should one
dread when fact and truth are one’s only aim? <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Du choc des opinions
jaillit la verité</i></span> was said by a French philosopher. If Theosophy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Spiritualism are no better than “gigantic frauds and will-o’-the-wisps of
the age” why such <em>expensive</em> crusades against both? And if they are
not, why should Agnostics and searchers after truth in general, help
bigoted and narrow-minded materialists, sectarians and dogmatists to
hide our light under a bushel by mere brutal force and usurped authority?
It is easy to surprise the good faith of the fair-minded. Still
easier to discredit that, which by its intrinsic strangeness, is already unpopular
and could hardly be credited in its palmiest days. “We welcome
no supposition so eagerly as one which accords with and intensifies our
own prejudices” says, in “Don Jesualdo,” a popular author. Therefore,
<em>facts</em> become often cunningly concocted “frauds;” and self-evident, glaring
lies are accepted as gospel truths at the first breeze of Don Basilio’s
<cite>Calumnia</cite>, by those to whose hard-crusted pre-conceptions such slander is
like heavenly dew.</p>

<p class='c028'>But, beloved enemies, “the light of Lucifer” may, after all, dispel some
of the surrounding darkness. The mighty roaring voice of denunciation,
so welcome to those whose little spites and hates and mental stagnation
in the grasp of the social <a id='corr85.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='respectabilily'>respectability</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_85.19'><ins class='correction' title='respectabilily'>respectability</ins></a></span> it panders to, may yet be silenced
by the voice of truth—“the still small voice”—whose destiny it ever was to
first preach in the desert. That cold and artificial light which still seems
to shine so dazzlingly over the alleged iniquities of professional mediums
and the supposed sins of commission and omission of <em>non-professional</em>
experimentalists, of free and independent theosophists, may yet be
extinguished at the height of all its glory. For it is not quite the perpetual
lamp of the alchemist philosopher. Still less is it that “light
which never shone on sea or land,” that ray of divine intuition, the spark
which glimmers latent in the spiritual, never-erring perceptions of man
and woman, and which is now awakening—for its time is at hand.
A few years more, and the Aladdin’s lamp, which called forth the ministering
genius thereof, who, making three salutes to the public, proceeded
forthwith to devour mediums and theosophists, like a juggler who
swallows swords at a village fair, will get out of order. Its light, over
which the anti-theosophists are crowing victory to this day, shall get dim.
And then, perhaps, it will be discovered that what was claimed as a
direct ray from the source of eternal truth was no better than a penny
rush-light, in whose deceitful smoke and soot people got hypnotized, and
saw everything upside down. It will be found that the hideous monsters
of fraud and imposture had no existence outside the murky and dizzied
brains of the Aladdins on their journey of discovery. And that, finally,
the good people who listened to them, had been all the time seeing
sights and hearing things under unconscious and mutual <em>suggestion</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is a scientific explanation, and requires no black magicians or
<em>dugpas</em> at work; for “suggestion” as now practised by the sorcerers of
science is—<em>dugpaship</em> itself, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pur sang</i></span>. No Eastern “adept of the <em>left</em>
hand” can do more mischief by his infernal art than a grave hypnotiser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the Faculty of Medicine, a disciple of Charcot, or of any other scientific
<em>light</em> of the first magnitude. In Paris, as in St. Petersburg, crimes have
been committed under “suggestion.” Divorces have occurred, and
husbands have nearly killed their wives and their supposed co-respondents,
owing to tricks played on innocent and respectable women,
who have thus had their fair name and all their future life blasted for
ever. A son, under such influence, broke open the desk of an avaricious
father, who caught him in the act, and nearly shot him in a fit of rage.
One of the keys of Occultism is in the hands of science—cold, heartless,
materialistic, and crassly ignorant of the other truly psychic side of the
phenomenon: hence, powerless to draw a line of demarcation between
the physiological and the purely spiritual effects of the disease inoculated,
and unable to prevent future results and consequences of which it has no
knowledge, and over which it has, therefore, no control.</p>

<p class='c035'>“Some months ago, already, in I forget what case, the question of ‘suggestion’ was
raised and taken account of by the judges. We shall certainly see people in the dock
accused of occult malpractices. But how will the prosecution go to work? What
arguments will it bring to bear? The crime by ‘suggestion’ is the ideal of a crime
without proof. In such a case the gravest charges will never be more than presumptions,
and fugitive presumptions. On what fragile scaffolding of suspicions will the
charge rest? No examination, but a moral one, will be possible. We shall have to
resign ourselves to hearing the Solicitor-general say to the accused: ‘Accused, it
appears from a perquisition made into your brain, etc.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Ah, the poor jurymen! it is they who are to be pitied. Taking their task to heart,
they already have the greatest difficulty in separating the true from the false, even in
rough and ready cases, the facts of which are obvious, all the details of which are
tangible and the responsibilities clear. And we are going to ask them on their soul
and conscience to decide questions of black magic! Verily their reason will not
hold out through the fortnight; it will give way before that and sink into thaumaturgy.</p>

<p class='c028'>We move fast. The strange trials for sorcery will blossom anew; somnabules who
were merely grotesque will appear in a tragic light; the coffee grounds, which so far
only risked the police court, will hear their sentence at the assizes. The evil eye
will figure among criminal offences. These last years of the XIXth century will have
seen us step from progress to progress, till we reach at last this judicial enormity: a
second Laubardemont prosecuting another Urbain Grandier.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Serious, scientific, and political papers are full of earnest discussions
on the subject. A St. Petersburg “Daily” has a long <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>feuilleton</i></span> on the
“Bearing of <em>Hypnotic Suggestions</em> upon Criminal Law.” “Cases of
Hypnotism with criminal motives have of late begun to increase in an
ever progressing ratio,” it tells its readers. And it is not the only newspaper,
nor is Russia the only country where the same tale is told.
Careful investigations and researches have been made by distinguished
lawyers and medical authorities. Data have been assiduously collected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and have revealed that the curious phenomenon,—which sceptics have
hitherto derided, and young people have included among their evening
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>petits jeux innocents</i></span>,—is a new and terrible danger to state and society.</p>

<p class='c028'>Two facts have now become patent to law and science:—</p>

<p class='c044'>(I.) <i>That, in the perceptions of the hypnotised subject, the visionary
representations called forth by “suggestion,” become real existing
actualities, the subject being, for the moment, the automatic executor
of the will of the hypnotiser; and</i>—</p>

<p class='c044'>(II.) <em>That the great majority of persons experimented upon, is subject to
hypnotic suggestion.</em></p>

<p class='c028'>Thus Liébeault found only <em>sixty</em> subjects intractable out of the <em>seven
hundred</em> he experimented upon; and Bernheim, out of 1,014 subjects,
failed with only <em>twenty-six</em>. The field for the natural-born <em>jadoo-wala</em>
(sorcery-mongers), is vast indeed! Evil has acquired a play-ground on
which it may now exercise its sway upon many a generation of unconscious
victims. For crimes undreamt of in the waking state, and felonies
of the blackest dye, are now invited and encouraged by the new “accursed
science.” The real perpetrators of these deeds of darkness may now
remain for ever hidden from the vengeance of human justice. The hand
which executes the criminal suggestion is only that of an irresponsible
automaton, whose memory preserves no trace of it, and who, moreover,
is a witness who can easily be disposed of by compulsory suicide—again
under “suggestion.” What better means than these could be offered to
the fiends of lust and revenge, to those dark Powers—called human
passions—ever on the look out to break the universal commandment:
“Thou shalt not steal, nor murder, nor lust after thy neighbour’s wife?”
Liébeault <em>suggested</em> to a young girl that she should poison herself with
prussic acid, and she swallowed the supposed drug without one moment’s
hesitation; Dr. Liégois <em>suggested</em> to a young woman that she owed him
5,000 francs, and the subject forthwith signed a cheque for the amount
Bernheim <em>suggested</em> to another hysterical girl a long and complicated
vision with regard to a criminal case. Two days after, although the
hypnotiser had not exercised any new pressure upon her in the interim,
she repeated distinctly the whole suggested story to a lawyer sent to her
for the purpose. Had her evidence been seriously accepted, it would
have brought the accused to the guillotine.</p>

<p class='c028'>These cases present two dark and terrible aspects. From the moral
stand point, such processes and <em>suggestions</em> leave an indelible stain upon
the purity of the subject’s nature. Even the innocent mind of a ten year
old child can thus be <a id='corr87.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>innoculated</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_87.40'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>innoculated</ins></a></span> with vice, the poison-germ of which
will develop in his subsequent <a id='corr87.41'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='life'>life.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_87.41'><ins class='correction' title='life'>life.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>On the judicial aspect it is needless to enter in great detail. Suffice
to say that it is this characteristic feature of the hypnotic state—the
absolute surrender of will and self-consciousness to the hypnotiser—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>possesses such importance, from its bearing upon crime, in the
eyes of legal authorities. For if the hypnotiser has the subject entirely
at his beck and call, so that he can cause him to commit any crime, acting,
so to say, invisibly within him, then what are not the terrible “judicial
mistakes” to be expected? What wonder then, that the jurisprudence
of one country after the other has taken alarm, and is devising, one after
the other, measures for repressing the exercise of hypnotism! In Denmark
it has just been forbidden. Scientists have experimented upon sensitives
with so much success that a hypnotised victim has been jeered and
hooted through the streets on his way to commit a crime, which he would
have completed unconsciously, had not the victim been warned beforehand
by the hypnotiser.</p>

<p class='c028'>In Brussels a recent and sad case is well-known to all. A young girl
of good family was seduced while in a hypnotised state by a man who
had first subjected her to his influence at a social gathering. She only
realised her condition a few months later, when her relatives, who divined
the criminal, forced her seducer to make the only possible reparation—that
of marrying his victim.</p>

<p class='c028'>The French Academy has just been debating the question:—how far
a hypnotised subject, from a mere victim, can become a regular tool of
crime. Of course, no jurist or legislator can remain indifferent to this
question; and it was averred that the crimes committed under <em>suggestion</em>
are so unprecedented that some of them can hardly be brought within
the scope of the law. Hence the prudent legal prohibition, just adopted
in France, which enacts that no person, save those legally qualified to
exercise the medical profession, shall hypnotise any other person. Even
the physician who enjoys such legal right is permitted to hypnotise a
person only in the presence of another qualified medical man, and with
the written permission of the subject. Public <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>séances</i></span> of hypnotism are
forbidden, and they are strictly confined to medical <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>cliniques</i></span> and laboratories.
Those who break this law are liable to a heavy fine and
imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the keynote has been struck, and many are the ways in which this
<em>black art</em> may be used—laws notwithstanding. That it will be so used,
the vile passions inherent in human nature are sufficient guarantee.</p>

<p class='c028'>Many and strange will be the romances yet enacted; for truth is often
stranger than fiction, and what is thought fiction is still more often truth.</p>

<p class='c028'>No wonder then that occult literature is growing with every day.
Occultism and sorcery are in the air, with no true philosophical knowledge
to guide the experimenters and thus check evil results. “Works of
<em>fiction</em>,” the various novels and romances are called. “Fiction” in the
arrangement of their characters and the adventures of their heroes and
heroines—admitted. Not so, as to the <em>facts</em> presented. These are <em>no
fictions</em>, but true <em>presentiments</em> of what lies in the bosom of the future,
and much of which is already born—nay corroborated by <em>scientific</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>experiments. Sign of the times! Close of a psychic cycle! The time for
phenomena with, or through mediums, whether professional or otherwise,
is gone by. It was the early season of the blossoming, of the era
mentioned even in the Bible;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a> the tree of Occultism is now preparing
for “fruiting,” and the Spirit of the Occult is awakening in the blood
of the new generations. If the old men only “dream dreams,” the young
ones see already visions,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and—record them in novels and works of
fiction. Woe to the ignorant and the unprepared, and those who listen
to the syrens of materialistic science! For indeed, indeed, many will be
the unconscious crimes committed, and many will be the victims who
will innocently suffer death by hanging and decapitation at the hands of
the righteous judges and the <em>too innocent</em> jurymen, both alike ignorant of
the fiendish power of “<span class='sc'>Suggestion</span>.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'>SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

<p class='c035'>The first necessity for obtaining self-knowledge is to become profoundly conscious
of ignorance; to feel with every fibre of the heart that one is <em>ceaselessly</em>
self-deceived.</p>

<p class='c028'>The second requisite is the still deeper conviction that such knowledge—such
intuitive and certain knowledge—can be obtained by effort.</p>

<p class='c028'>The third and most important is an indomitable determination to obtain and
face that knowledge.</p>

<p class='c028'>Self-knowledge of this kind is unattainable by what men usually call “self-analysis.”
It is not reached by reasoning or any brain process; for it is the
awakening to consciousness of the Divine nature of man.</p>

<p class='c028'>To obtain this knowledge is a greater achievement than to command the
elements or to know the future.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>The first four rules of Light on the Path are, undoubtedly, curious
though the statement may seem, the most important in the
whole book, save one only. Why they are so important is that
they contain the vital law, the very creative essence of the astral man.
And it is only in the astral (or self-illuminated) consciousness that the rules
which follow them have any living meaning. Once attain to the use of the
astral senses and it becomes a matter of course that one commences to
use them; and the later rules are but guidance in their use. When I
speak like this I mean, naturally, that the first four rules are the ones
which are of importance and interest to those who read them in print
upon a page. When they are engraved on the man’s heart and on his
life, unmistakably then the other rules become not merely interesting,
or extraordinary, metaphysical statements, but actual facts in life which
have to be grasped and experienced.</p>

<p class='c028'>The four rules stand written in the great chamber of every actual
lodge of a living Brotherhood. Whether the man is about to sell his
soul to the devil, like Faust; whether he is to be worsted in the battle,
like Hamlet; or whether he is to pass on within the precincts; in any case
these words are for him. The man can choose between virtue and vice,
but not until he is a man; a babe or a wild animal cannot so choose.
Thus with the disciple, he must first become a disciple before he can
even see the paths to choose between. This effort of creating himself
as a disciple, the re-birth, he must do for himself without any teacher.
Until the four rules are learned no teacher can be of any use to him;
and that is why “the Masters” are referred to in the way they are. No
real masters, whether adepts in power, in love, or in blackness, can
affect a man till these four rules are passed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Tears, as I have said, may be called the moisture of life. The soul
must have laid aside the emotions of humanity, must have secured a
balance which cannot be shaken by misfortune, before its eyes can open
upon the super-human world.</p>

<p class='c028'>The voice of the Masters is always in the world; but only those hear it
whose ears are no longer receptive of the sounds which affect the personal
life. Laughter no longer lightens the heart, anger may no longer
enrage it, tender words bring it no balm. For that within, to which the
ears are as an outer gateway, is an unshaken place of peace in itself
which no person can disturb.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>As the eyes are the windows of the soul, so are the ears its gateways
or doors. Through them comes knowledge of the confusion of the
world. The great ones who have conquered life, who have become more
than disciples, stand at peace and undisturbed amid the vibration and
kaleidoscopic movement of humanity. They hold within themselves a
certain knowledge, as well as a perfect peace; and thus they are not
roused or excited by the partial and erroneous fragments of information
which are brought to their ears by the changing voices of those around
them. When I speak of knowledge, I mean intuitive knowledge. This
certain information can never be obtained by hard work, or by experiment;
for these methods are only applicable to matter, and matter is in
itself a perfectly uncertain substance, continually affected by change.
The most absolute and universal laws of natural and physical life, as
understood by the scientist, will pass away when the life of this universe
has passed away, and only its soul is left in the silence. What then will
be the value of the knowledge of its laws acquired by industry and
observation? I pray that no reader or critic will imagine that by what I
have said I intend to depreciate or disparage acquired knowledge, or the
work of scientists. On the contrary, I hold that scientific men are the
pioneers of modern thought. The days of literature and of art, when
poets and sculptors saw the divine light, and put it into their own great
language—these days lie buried in the long past with the ante-Phidian
sculptors and the pre-Homeric poets. The mysteries no longer rule the
world of thought and beauty; human life is the governing power, not
that which lies beyond it. But the scientific workers are progressing,
not so much by their own will as by sheer force of circumstances, towards
the far line which divides things interpretable from things uninterpretable.
Every fresh discovery drives them a step onward. Therefore
do I very highly esteem the knowledge obtained by work and
experiment.</p>

<p class='c028'>But intuitive knowledge is an entirely different thing. It is not
acquired in any way, but is, so to speak, a faculty of the soul; not the
animal soul, that which becomes a ghost after death, when lust or liking
or the memory of ill-deeds holds it to the neighbourhood of human beings,
but the divine soul which animates all the external forms of the individualised
being.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is, of course, a faculty which indwells in that soul, which is inherent.
The would-be disciple has to arouse himself to the consciousness
of it by a fierce and resolute and indomitable effort of will. I use the
word indomitable for a special reason. Only he who is untameable, who
cannot be dominated, who knows he has to play the lord over men, over
facts, over all things save his own divinity, can arouse this faculty. “With
faith all things are possible.” The sceptical laugh at faith and pride
themselves on its absence from their own minds. The truth is that faith
is a great engine, an enormous power, which in fact can accomplish all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>things. For it is the covenant or engagement between man’s divine part
and his lesser self.</p>

<p class='c028'>The use of this engine is quite necessary in order to obtain intuitive
knowledge; for unless a man believes such knowledge exists within himself
how can he claim and use it?</p>

<p class='c028'>Without it he is more helpless than any drift-wood or wreckage on the
great tides of the ocean. They are cast hither and thither indeed; so
may a man be by the chances of fortune. But such adventures are purely
external and of very small account. A slave may be dragged through
the streets in chains, and yet retain the quiet soul of a philosopher, as
was well seen in the person of Epictetus. A man may have every worldly
prize in his possession, and stand absolute master of his personal fate, to
all appearance, and yet he knows no peace, no certainty, because he is
shaken within himself by every tide of thought that he touches on. And
these changing tides do not merely sweep the man bodily hither and
thither like driftwood on the water; that would be nothing. They enter
into the gateways of his soul, and wash over that soul and make it blind
and blank and void of all permanent intelligence, so that passing impressions
affect it.</p>

<p class='c028'>To make my meaning plainer I will use an illustration. Take an
author at his writing, a painter at his canvas, a composer listening to the
melodies that dawn upon his glad imagination; let any one of these
workers pass his daily hours by a wide window looking on a busy street.
The power of the animating life blinds sight and hearing alike, and the
great traffic of the city goes by like nothing but a passing pageant. But
a man whose mind is empty, whose day is objectless, sitting at that same
window, notes the passers-by and remembers the faces that chance to
please or interest him. So it is with the mind in its relation to eternal
truth. If it no longer transmits its fluctuations, its partial knowledge,
its unreliable information to the soul, then in the inner place of peace
already found when the first rule has been learned—in that inner place
there leaps into flame the light of actual knowledge. Then the ears
begin to hear. Very dimly, very faintly at first. And, indeed, so faint
and tender are these first indications of the commencement of true
actual life, that they are sometimes pushed aside as mere fancies, mere
imaginings.</p>

<p class='c028'>But before these are capable of becoming more than mere imaginings,
the abyss of nothingness has to be faced in another form. The utter
silence which can only come by closing the ears to all transitory sounds
comes as a more appalling horror than even the formless emptiness of
space. Our only mental conception of blank space is, I think, when
reduced to its barest element of thought, that of black darkness. This is
a great physical terror to most persons, and when regarded as an eternal
and unchangeable fact, must mean to the mind the idea of annihilation
rather than anything else. But it is the obliteration of one sense only;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and the sound of a voice may come and bring comfort even in the
profoundest darkness. The disciple, having found his way into this
blackness, which is the fearful abyss, must then so shut the gates of his
soul that no comforter can enter there nor any enemy. And it is in
making this second effort that the fact of pain and pleasure being but
one sensation becomes recognisable by those who have before been
unable to perceive it. For when the solitude of silence is reached the
soul hungers so fiercely and passionately for some sensation on which to
rest, that a painful one would be as keenly welcomed as a pleasant one.
When this consciousness is reached the courageous man by seizing and
retaining it, may destroy the “sensitiveness” at once. When the ear no
longer discriminates between that which is pleasant or that which is
painful, it will no longer be affected by the voices of others. And then
it is safe and possible to open the doors of the soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Sight” is the first effort, and the easiest, because it is accomplished
partly by an intellectual effort. The intellect can conquer the heart, as
is well known in ordinary life. Therefore, this preliminary step still
lies within the dominion of matter. But the second step allows of no
such assistance, nor of any material aid whatever. Of course, I mean
by material aid the action of the brain, or emotions, or human soul. In
compelling the ears to listen only to the eternal silence, the being we
call man becomes something which is no longer man. A very superficial
survey of the thousand and one influences which are brought to
bear on us by others will show that this must be so. A disciple will
fulfil all the duties of his manhood; but he will fulfil them according to
his own sense of right, and not according to that of any person or body
of persons. This is a very evident result of following the creed of
knowledge instead of any of the blind creeds.</p>

<p class='c028'>To obtain the pure silence necessary for the disciple, the heart and
emotions, the brain and its intellectualisms, have to be put aside. Both
are but mechanisms, which will perish with the span of man’s life. It
is the essence beyond, that which is the motive power, and makes man
live, that is now compelled to rouse itself and act. Now is the greatest
hour of danger. In the first trial men go mad with fear; of this first
trial Bulwer Lytton wrote. No novelist has followed to the second
trial, though some of the poets have. Its subtlety and great danger lies
in the fact that in the measure of a man’s strength is the measure of
his chance of passing beyond it or coping with it at all. If he has power
enough to awaken that unaccustomed part of himself, the supreme
essence, then has he power to lift the gates of gold, then is he the true
alchemist, in possession of the elixir of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is at this point of experience that the occultist becomes separated
from all other men and enters on to a life which is his own; on to the
path of individual accomplishment instead of mere obedience to the
genii which rule our earth. This raising of himself into an individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>power does in reality identify him with the nobler forces of life and make
him one with them. For they stand beyond the powers of this earth
and the laws of this universe. Here lies man’s only hope of success in
the great effort; to leap right away from his present standpoint to his next
and at once become an intrinsic part of the divine power as he has been
an intrinsic part of the intellectual power, of the great nature to which he
belongs. He stands always in advance of himself, if such a contradiction
can be understood. It is the men who adhere to this position, who
believe in their innate power of progress, and that of the whole race, who
are the elders brothers, the pioneers. Each man has to accomplish the
great leap for himself and without aid; yet it is something of a staff to
lean on to know that others have gone on that road. It is possible that
they have been lost in the abyss; no matter, they have had the courage
to enter it. Why I say that it is possible they have been lost in the
abyss is because of this fact, that one who has passed through is unrecognizable
until the other and altogether new condition is attained by both.
It is unnecessary to enter upon the subject of what that condition is at
present. I only say this, that in the early state in which man is entering
upon the silence he loses knowledge of his friends, of his lovers, of all who
have been near and dear to him; and also loses sight of his teachers and
of those who have preceded him on his way. I explain this because
scarce one passes through without bitter complaint. Could but the mind
grasp beforehand that the silence must be complete, surely this complaint
need not arise as a hindrance on the path. Your teacher, or your predecessor
may hold your hand in his, and give you the utmost sympathy the
human heart is capable of. But when the silence and the darkness comes,
you lose all knowledge of him; you are alone and he cannot help you,
not because his power is gone, but because you have invoked your great
enemy.</p>

<p class='c028'>By your great enemy, I mean yourself. If you have the power to face
your own soul in the darkness and silence, you will have conquered the
physical or animal self which dwells in sensation only.</p>

<p class='c028'>This statement, I feel, will appear involved; but in reality it is quite
simple. Man, when he has reached his fruition, and civilization is at its
height, stands between two fires. Could he but claim his great inheritance,
the encumbrance of the mere animal life would fall away from
him without difficulty. But he does not do this, and so the races of men
flower and then droop and die and decay off the face of the earth,
however splendid the bloom may have been. And it is left to the
individual to make this great effort; to refuse to be terrified by his
greater nature, to refuse to be drawn back by his lesser or more material
self. Every individual who accomplishes this is a redeemer of the race.
He may not blazon forth his deeds, he may dwell in secret and silence;
but it is a fact that he forms a link between man and his divine part;
between the known and the unknown; between the stir of the market-place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and the stillness of the snow-capped Himalayas. He has not to
go about among men in order to form this link; in the astral he <em>is</em> that
link, and this fact makes him a being of another order from the rest of
mankind. Even so early on the road towards knowledge, when he has
but taken the second step, he finds his footing more certain, and becomes
conscious that he is a recognised part of a whole.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is one of the contradictions in life which occur so constantly
that they afford fuel to the fiction writer. The occultist finds them
become much more marked as he endeavours to live the life he has
chosen. As he retreats within himself and becomes self-dependent, he
finds himself more definitely becoming part of a great tide of definite
thought and feeling. When he has learned the first lesson, conquered
the hunger of the heart, and refused to live on the love of others, he
finds himself more capable of inspiring love. As he flings life away it
comes to him in a new form and with a new meaning. The world has
always been a place with many contradictions in it, to the man; when he
becomes a disciple he finds life is describable as a series of paradoxes.
This is a fact in nature, and the reason for it is intelligible enough.
Man’s soul “dwells like a star apart,” even that of the vilest among us;
while his consciousness is under the law of vibratory and sensuous life.
This alone is enough to cause those complications of character which are
the material for the novelist; every man is a mystery, to friend and
enemy alike, and to himself. His motives are often undiscoverable, and
he cannot probe to them or know why he does this or that. The
disciple’s effort is that of awaking consciousness in this starry part of
himself, where his power and divinity lie sleeping. As this consciousness
becomes awakened, the contradictions in the man himself become
more marked than ever; and so do the paradoxes which he lives
through. For, of course man creates his own life; and “adventures are
to the adventurous” is one of those wise proverbs which are drawn from
actual fact, and cover the whole area of human experience.</p>

<p class='c028'>Pressure on the divine part of man re-acts upon the animal part. As
the silent soul awakes it makes the ordinary life of the man more
purposeful, more vital, more real, and responsible. To keep to the two
instances already mentioned, the occultist who has withdrawn into his
own citadel has found his strength; immediately he becomes aware of
the demands of duty upon him. He does not obtain his strength by
his own right, but because he is a part of the whole; and as soon as he
is safe from the vibration of life and can stand unshaken, the outer
world cries out to him to come and labour in it. So with the heart.
When it no longer wishes to take, it is called upon to give abundantly.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Light on the Path” has been called a book of paradoxes, and very
justly; what else could it be, when it deals with the actual personal
experience of the disciple?</p>

<p class='c028'>To have acquired the astral senses of sight and hearing; or in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>words to have attained perception and opened the doors of the soul, are
gigantic tasks and may take the sacrifice of many successive incarnations.
And yet, when the will has reached its strength, the whole
miracle may be worked in a second of time. Then is the disciple the
servant of Time no longer.</p>

<p class='c028'>These two first steps are negative; that is to say they imply retreat
from a present condition of things rather than advance towards another.
The two next are active, implying the advance into another state

<h3 class='c018'>WILL AND DESIRE.</h3>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>Will</span> is the exclusive possession of man on this our plane of consciousness. It
divides him from the brute in whom instinctive desire only is active.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Desire</span>, in its widest application, is the one creative force in the Universe.
In this sense it is indistinguishable from Will; but we men never know desire
under this form while we remain only men. Therefore Will and Desire are
here considered as opposed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus Will is the offspring of the Divine, the God in man; Desire the motive
power of the animal life.</p>

<p class='c028'>Most men live in and by desire, mistaking it for will. But he who would
achieve must separate will from desire, and make his will the ruler; for desire is
unstable and ever changing, while will is steady and constant.</p>

<p class='c028'>Both will and desire are absolute <em>creators</em>, forming the man himself and his
surroundings. But will creates intelligently—desire blindly and unconsciously.
The man, therefore, makes himself in the image of his desires, unless he
creates himself in the likeness of the Divine, through his will, the child of the
light.</p>

<p class='c028'>His task is twofold: to awaken the will, to strengthen it by use and conquest,
to make it absolute ruler within his body; and, parallel with this, to purify
desire.</p>

<p class='c028'>Knowledge and will are the tools for the accomplishment of this purification.</p>

<p class='c028'>In illustration of the Mahatmic condition, it may be well to quote
some extracts from “Five Years of Theosophy,” on pp. 215, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et seq.</i></span></p>

<p class='c028'>“The principal object of the Yogi is to realise the oneness of
existence, and the practice of morality is the most powerful means to
that end. The principal obstacle to this realization is the inborn habit
of man of always placing himself at the centre of the Universe.
Whatever a man might act, think, or feel, the irrepressible personality
is sure to be the central figure. This, as will appear on reflection, is
that which prevents every individual from filling his proper sphere in
existence, where he only is in place, and no other individual is. The
realization of this harmony is the practical objective aspect of the
‘Grand Problem.’.... It availeth nothing to intellectually grasp
the notion of your being everything ... if it is not realized in
daily life. To confuse ‘meum and tuum’ in the vulgar sense is but to
destroy the harmony of existence by a false assertion of ‘I,’ and is as
foolish as the attempt to nourish the legs at the expense of the arms.
You cannot be one with Nature, unless all your acts, thoughts, and feelings,
synchronize with the onward march of Nature. What is meant by
a Brahmajnani being beyond the reach of Karma, can be realised only
by a man who has found out his exact position in harmony with the
one Life in Nature; that man can see how a Brahmajnani can act only
in unison with Nature, and never in discord with it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“To use the phraseology of old occult writers, the Brahmajnani is a
real co-worker with Nature.... Many have fallen into the error
of supposing that a human being can escape the operation of the law of
Karma by adopting a condition of masterly inactivity, entirely losing
sight of the fact that even a rigid abstinence from physical acts does not
produce inactivity on the higher astral and spiritual planes....
Such a supposition is nothing short of a delusion.... There is a
tendency in every department of Nature for an act to repeat itself.
The Karma acquired in the last preceding birth is always trying to forge
fresh links in the chain, and thereby lead to continued material existence.
This tendency can only be counteracted by unselfishly performing all the
duties pertaining to the sphere in which a person is born. Such a
course can alone produce purification of the mind, without which the
capacity of perceiving spiritual truths can never be acquired.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Such a moral standard as this may be considered as the main working
factor in the existence of a Mahatma. He exists by, through, and in
harmony, and, as Mahatma, is harmony itself. It is impossible to carry
these speculations further, for beyond the fact that these considerations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>are in analogy with the great law of nature, ordinary human intelligence
can gain nothing from them. The Mahatma is a Mahatma, and only
those who have reached that supreme condition can describe it, and even
then it is doubtful whether words would express it. The word Mahatma
has been used with some hesitation, as it might possibly require an article
of great length to give the least idea of what it means. But some idea
of the true position of these exalted beings (known in India and Tibet by
this name) may be gathered from the foregoing pages if any conception
of the connection of humanity with the law of Karma, and also of
liberated humanity with the law of harmony, can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the preceding pages especial reference has been made to the fact
that the Mahatma, as such, has no Karma, but it is by no means
intended to convey the idea that all who enter Occultism, and even
those who have progressed a very long way on the Path of Life, are
Mahatmas. Nay, more! There are many of them who are very holy,
and even exalted, beings, but who are still subject to the law of Karma,
as applied to ordinary humanity. But they have acquired self-mastery
to an extraordinary degree, and their whole attention is “fixed on the
eternal.” Thus, so far as they are concerned, they generate no new
Karma in the restricted sense, but only progress towards Universal
Harmony.</p>

<p class='c028'>To put it shortly, they exhaust their old Karma of past lives, and
devote themselves to the production of Harmony.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is important to bear this in mind when the attention is turned to
the Karmic condition of ordinary humanity. For we are at once
brought face to face with the old and much disputed question between
free-will and predestination.</p>

<p class='c028'>At this point, therefore, it will be necessary to enter, at some length,
on this question, because it has been supposed that the idea of Karma is
identical, or nearly so, with that of predestination. Consequently, it
will be necessary to attempt a definition of what Free-will and Will are.
Will, to the ordinary man, is known according to his experience as the
power to do or not to do an action. So far, he is perfectly right, but, as
usual, man limits the action of his will to the physical plane, and takes
no account of even the mental plane. Even if he does not commit an
action, he cannot help thinking about it, because he has desired to do it—even
if he has repressed that desire. Nothing is more common than
to hear anyone say, “I can’t help my likes and dislikes,” or, in other
words, their attractions and repulsions, desires and the reverse. Consequently,
until a man can control his desires, those desires control his
will, and, consequently, predestination appears to rule the day. Thus we
find that it is desire which impels man onward on his course, and governs
that course to a very large extent, and this is the principle which is at
its highest development in mankind as a rule. Now if it be granted that
the human personality—a transient thing—has been constituted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>man’s vanity as the centre of the Universe, it is plain that the combination
of this principle of desire with the pronounced personality,
will only serve to intensify this personality and bind man fast to it.
Man thus constituted is a prisoner, and, more often than not, is so attached
to his prison that he prefers to flutter his wings against the bars of his
cage, instead of endeavouring to escape. But are there any means of
escape:—it may be asked? Desire binds man fast to his personality,
and intensifies one personality against another. Hence it is productive
of strife and discord, and militates strongly against the law of universal
harmony, or Karma, in this aspect. Thus desire and Karma would
seem to be in complete opposition, and desire cannot be said to be a
consequence of Karma. But really this is a confusion of terms, for all
this only exists in the world of effects and not in that of causes. Desire
is an effect of the accentuated personality, and in its turn produces that
personality. This constitutes the prison, and the only means of escape
from this prison of discord is the endeavour to produce harmony in its
place. Thus, therefore, we have a definition of will as being not only that
which represses a desire, but also an emanation of the one divine
principle, and proceeding from the divine in man. In one sense, this will,
this harmonizer of the discord, is identical with Karma. As a consequence,
we can see that Karma produces punishment. That punishment
arises from the fact that the assertion of both desire and will in any
man makes him the battle-field of two opposing forces—the desire to
do anything, and thus gratify the desire, and the will to repress it. Thus
man must be a co-worker with nature and the law of harmony. He has
to repress the Typhonic principle of desire and dissipate its energy. If
he does not, it will bind him more firmly to his “personal centre,” accentuate
his punishment, and hang like a millstone round his neck in
the shape of Karmic effects, which generate fresh tendencies and desires.</p>

<p class='c028'>The real function of will is to promote harmony between man and
the great law by repressing desire. Liberation from the <em>effects</em> of Karma
will come to the man who grasps his whole individuality firmly (not merely
his personality), and, by the force of his awakened <em>spiritual</em> will, recognises
this individuality as not himself, but as a thing to use in passing beyond
the life of the individuality.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus the direction of will should be towards realizing one’s aspirations,
and so give man “a glimpse into the eternal;” the lower consciousness
will mirror these aspirations, even unconsciously to itself, and then
itself aspires and is elevated if all is in accord.</p>

<p class='c028'>But this is not free-will in the ordinary sense of the term; and it
does not seem possible that such should exist in view of the ideas
of Karmic effects and of reincarnation. It is in these two that lie all the
objections to free-will, because too short a view has been taken of human
life. In the dim vistas of time, and the countless incarnations which
have taken place in them, it will at once be seen that the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>being has generated innumerable causes, the effects of which are still
to be experienced. Thus it is free-will that man has, but not in the ordinary
sense; it is free-will limited by countless other free-wills around
him—limited too and circumscribed by his own acts. Man makes
himself a prisoner, and believes himself free. He is right in his belief
in a measure, for in virtue of the will he is free—to aspire and soar
into the sublime heights of his own higher nature. He is a prisoner and
predestined when he confines himself to his personality. Karma is at
once his gaoler and his liberator, and the decision lies in the intensity of
his aspirations, and is therefore in his own hands. Thus from the personal
view predestination is true, but not from that of the spirit, which is free.
From the latter view, and to a reasoning mind, the Calvinistic doctrine
sounds little short of blasphemy. It is most certainly a contradiction
in terms to speak of God as an all-wise, all-powerful and entirely just
God, and then to speak of predestination as one of his laws, a law
which, in face of the above qualities, and with that of mercy in addition,
dooms countless millions to an eternity of pain and suffering as punishment,
and that too before they are even born. When the apparent
injustice of the lives of men is viewed and argued, it is because men
forget what they have done in previous lives, in which they have violated
the law in a very material direction, which leads them into these positions
and from which they have to escape.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus the aspirations of man constitute that which sets man free, and
which therefore represent his free-will. It is then well to endeavour
to trace these aspirations in man with regard to Karma. The second
section of the third part of “Light on the Path,” speaks on this point
with no uncertain voice. The Occultist must pluck and eat the fruit of
the tree of knowledge, and step on either the good or the evil path.
And to do this knowingly produces great Karmic results. The mass
of men walk waveringly, uncertain as to their goal, their standard of
life is indefinite; the Occultist cannot be half-hearted, nor can he
return when he has passed the threshold. “The individuality has
approached the state of responsibility by reason of growth; it cannot
recede from it.” The one means of escape from Karma is for the
Occultist to live in the Eternal. But below this—the threshold—many
men aspire. On this point, we may quote, “Five Years of Theosophy,”
p. 226.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The unintelligent aspiration towards goodness propagates itself and
leads to good lives in the future; the intelligent aspiration propagates
itself in the same way, plus the propagation of intelligence; and this
distinction shows the gulf of difference which may exist between
the growth of a human soul, which merely drifts along the stream of
time, and that of one which is consciously steered by an intelligent
purpose throughout. The human Ego, which acquires the habit of
seeking for knowledge, becomes invested, life after life, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>qualifications which ensure the success of such a search, until the final
success, achieved at some critical period of its existence, carries it right
up into the company of those perfected Egos, which are the fully
developed flowers only expected from a few of the thousand seeds.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now it is clear that a slight impulse in a given direction, even on
the physical plane, does not produce the same effect as a stronger one;
so exactly in this matter of engendering habits which are required to
persist in their operation through a succession of lives it is quite
obvious that the strong impulse of a very ardent aspiration towards
knowledge will be more likely than a weaker one to triumph over
the so-called accidents of nature.”</p>

<p class='c028'>These considerations bring us to the question of those habits of life
which are more immediately associated with the pursuit of occult
science. It will be quite plain that the generation within his own
nature of affinities in the direction of spiritual progress is a matter
which has very little to do with the outer circumstances of a man’s daily
life. It cannot be dissociated from what may be called the outer
circumstances of his moral life, for an occult student, whose moral
nature is consciously ignoble, and who combines the pursuit of
knowledge with the practice of wrong, becomes by that condition
of things a student of sorcery rather than of true Occultism.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus so far traced Karma in one of its aspects is, “the ethical law
of causation.” This law descends in its action below the moral plane,
and is observed as the law of compensation on the physical plane. Thus
the physical, intellectual and emotional planes, are all affected by
Karma. The key to the situation is the mind; and, as we have seen,
the liberation of the mind must be the most difficult task. If the
powers of the mind are concentrated on the attainment of the highest
ideal, Karma has no basis in which to inhere and consequently the
tendency to commit actions from lower motives is annihilated. Even
repentance, from this point of view, is a mistake, as it necessarily draws
the mind back to the actions and motives repented of. Consequently
by the exertion of free will, in the aspiration to realize the ideal, man
becomes his own Saviour; and the true way to do this is to look
neither for reward nor punishment; to detach the mind from all considerations
below that of the spiritual life, and to live only in the Eternal.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>Gaston paused at the entrance to the chamber, and even detected
himself in taking an involuntary step backwards, for
the singular illusion was heightened by the circumstance that
many of the figures which were suspended perpendicularly from the
walls, and had fallen a little forward, looked as though they were trying
to let themselves down. But the monk, nothing concerned, went stolidly
on down the long narrow chamber, which had other chambers, or corridors,
leading out of it in several directions. To speak more correctly,
there was a series of vaults, branching several ways, some of which were
shut off from the rest by open-work screens or gates of wool.</p>

<p class='c028'>The walls on either side were piled high with coffins, the greater
number of which had one of their sides of glass, exposing to view the
hideous shrouded tenants. By whatever art it had been sought to
preserve these bodies from decay, Nature had declared in every instance
that it should not be, and no ghastlier assemblage of mummified and
mouldering corpses could have mocked the grief of the relatives who
should have given their dead to the grave. On the blackened and
distorted faces of some, it was not difficult to read a look of supplication
which the parted and fleshless lips seemed striving to translate in this
way: “Take us away from this dreadful place and hide us in the decent
earth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>They lay there, all of them, in their coffins, in wrappings of linen,
silk, and velvet; men, and women, and children, and little infants;
priests, nobles, merchants—a world of dead ones; hundreds and
thousands of them.</p>

<p class='c028'>Upon the faces of some, decay seemed working with a kind of
fantastic cruelty: punching a hole in the cheek or forehead; pushing one
eye from its socket, and leaving the other; stripping the skin from one
side of the face, and leaving it like a bit of wrinkled parchment on the
other.</p>

<p class='c028'>Some were made to laugh from ear to ear; some had the corners of
the mouth drawn down and the features twisted, as though pain haunted
them in death; others looked defiant, derisive, amazed, indignant.
The majesty of death had fled from all of them, mockery and shame
had come to take its place. The worms were being avenged on these
who should have gone to feed them. Silent and rotting, they had no
part in either world; and shrinking continually within their coffins, they
cried mutely on decay to hasten his work, and give them the boon of
nothingness.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Above the line of coffins, on both sides of the chamber, hundreds of
clothed and hooded creatures—skeletons in all except the face, which
for the most part retained its covering of dried and tarnished skin—were
suspended from the walls. Each had a ticket pinned to its dress,
bearing the name and the date of death.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was these figures on the walls which gave the chamber its most
dreadful aspect. Some were suspended by the neck, like suicides left
there for an example. Others in various gruesome fashions parodied
the attitudes of life. There was a grotesque group composed of three
figures which had tumbled together in such a manner that the two on
either side appeared to whisper into the ears of the third. Some had
the neck awry, the head on one side, in a listening or questioning
attitude; of others the head had sunk forward on the narrow breast.
The jaw of some had dropped, and protruded a row of teeth, with a
savage or jeering air.</p>

<p class='c028'>Every variety of grimace and grin was shown on those appalling
faces; and as Gaston passed down the chamber fingers poked at him
from gaping sleeves; he was laughed at, mocked at, scowled at; and
when he looked behind him, all these skeletons were laughing, mocking,
and scowling at one another. Many of the faces were little else but
grinning mouths, and to those whose mouths stood wide open his
imagination gave voices, so that the vaults seemed filled with the cries
and laughter of the dead.</p>

<p class='c028'>The monk went steadily on in front of him, waving his candle to and
fro; and as the smell was nauseate and oppressed the nostrils, he spat
occasionally upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c028'>His bit of candle burnt itself out before he had taken Gaston completely
round, and he returned to fetch another, leaving Gaston in a
corner of the vault where the light was a mere glimmer. Right opposite
to him in this place was a massive coffin with rich chasings, whose
grisly inmate was wrapped from head to foot in a mantle of black
velvet. Every particle of flesh had melted from the face, the hair had
fallen from the head, the eyeless sockets stared from the depths of the
velvet hood. The skeleton was richly dight and finely housed; it was
Death himself lying in state.</p>

<p class='c028'>The monk came up with a fresh candle, and Gaston stooped down
and peered into the coffin. Above the figure’s head was affixed a
miniature on ivory, which represented a young man in the first prime of
life, of a refined and beautiful countenance. In the folds of the mantle
a card had tumbled, and stooping lower, Gaston read on it the name of
Udalrico Verga. There was a small round hole in the skull, just over
the left temple.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>Ucciso</em>, signor!</span>” (Murdered!) said the monk, behind him.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Italian word sounded softly in the lips of the monk; but there
was the tell-tale hole in the forehead.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>This then was the hero and the victim of that old tragedy; this was
the end of him! But for his punctured skull, he might have changed
places with any of the least repulsive of his skeleton companions. But
his little bullet-hole marked him out from all of them. Curiously, the
hood had slipped off from the left side of the skull, and as this was the
side next to the spectator, the bullet-hole compelled attention to itself at
once.</p>

<p class='c028'>The story of the murder which the baron had told to Gaston, and
with which his thoughts had many times been occupied in the Villa
Torcello, came before him again; and looking at the stark remains of
the victim of that forgotten crime, he felt a sudden and irresistible
longing to know its secret. If he could win it from the coffin there!
But the grim rest within would be disturbed no more. And the young
man pictured there beside the skeleton? Murder had no meaning for
him; he had not come to know it when he was pictured thus. The
face impressed Gaston strangely. He looked at it long, till he began to
fancy that behind its delicate beauty he saw the tokens of a latent
sensuality. But it was a face of singular sweetness, and if any evil were
there, it existed only in the colourless form of a suggestion.</p>

<p class='c028'>And the priest, who had died a suspect? Was <em>he</em> here, and did death
whisper anything against him? No, the monk said; the priest was a
native of Syracuse, and after his death his body had been carried
there.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gaston had seen enough; the chamber and its horrid tenants had
given him a sense of physical sickness; and, above all, some curious
malign influence seemed to issue from the coffin of Udalrico Verga,
which was working its way into his brain.</p>

<p class='c028'>The words of the Baron came into his mind: “They say the spirit
haunts the place, seeking some one to avenge the murder.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Placing a five-franc note in the hand of the monk, he left the chamber
and the monastery at once; and entering the carriage, he was driven home.</p>

<p class='c028'>By morning he had shaken off the morbid effects of his visit to the
Capucins’; but his imagination had become the seat of a vague and
indefinable oppression. This, at length, when analysed, resolved itself
into a certain feeling of injury on account of Udalrico Verga. The
wonderful amiableness, joined to an almost womanly beauty, of the face
he had seen imaged in the coffin, had touched his sympathies; and
now the memory of it began to lay hold on his affections. For what
cause, and by whose hand, had the young Udalrico died so brutally?</p>

<p class='c028'>The tale of the murder stuck in his mind; it possessed him; it would
not be dislodged. And the tale, though begun a whole generation since,
was still unfinished. It told that Verga had been murdered; but who
had murdered him?</p>

<p class='c028'>This question uttered itself again and again; it grew <a id='corr104.44'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='importunate'>importunate.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_104.44'><ins class='correction' title='importunate'>importunate.</ins></a></span>
One evening in particular it became a kind of clamour in his ears;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>when, walking by moonlight in the garden of the villa, he was suddenly
conscious that a presence other than his own was with him. Turning
about, he beheld vividly, at a distance from him of twelve or fifteen
paces, the figure of a young and elegant man. The view of this figure
which his eyes took in, and the impression which it made upon his
mind, were so distinct, that, but for a single circumstance, he would have
suspected nothing abnormal in the appearance. The features were those
of Udalrico Verga.</p>

<p class='c028'>His reason still urging him to reject the testimony of his sight, Gaston
advanced nearer to the figure. It remained motionless, outlined distinctly
in the moonlight, on the path bordered by a row of pepper trees
where the body of Verga had been found. Again Gaston went forward;
he could now by stretching out his hand almost have touched the figure;
his eyes looked straight into the eyes of the man whom he knew to have
lain for thirty years in his coffin. While gazing fixedly and with fascination
upon this creature from the grave, which, though he knew it to be
bodiless, seemed full real to him, Gaston felt his senses being subdued;
and, before he could exert will enough to repel an influence which flowed
in upon him as it were waves of blinding light, he was rapt out of
himself, and held for the space of a minute or so in what is best described
as a magnetic sleep or trance. He remained upright and rigid;
his brain a whirl of excitement, with an accompanying painful consciousness;
the body of the emotion being a confused and very indefinite
feeling of fear—whether for himself or for some other person,
he did not know. This feeling becoming slightly more definite, he knew
that the fear he felt was not for himself, but for another; yet who that
other was, he could not tell. It was the same when a voice said plainly
in his ear, that what had been begun must be finished; the voice was
piercing in its clearness, and he knew that it was the voice of one dear
to him; but whose, he could not divine.</p>

<p class='c028'>This curious sleep lasted, as I have said, for about a minute; and
when Gaston awoke he was standing precisely as he had been when
seized in the trance. He looked for the apparition; it was not there.
He moved to the path, placed himself on the very spot where, but a
minute before, the form in the likeness of Udalrico Verga had stood.
There was nothing. He looked round him; from this path he could
see over the whole garden; it slept motionless in the moonlight, and his
was the only figure in it. Gaston returned to the house in a condition
of extreme nervous excitement.</p>

<p class='c028'>In this condition, and almost before he had reached the room in
which he usually sat, the story of the murder was flashed in upon his
mind; he read it as plainly as if it were traced in English characters on
the wall before him. Fancying himself still under some abnormous
influence, which when it passed away would carry the story with it, he
at once sat down and committed an abstract of it to paper.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>All that night, the story swam in his brain, and rising early next
morning, he resolved—or rather was impelled—to commence writing it
immediately. He did so, and in the full light of day the wraith of
Udalrico Verga stood beside him, and he plainly saw it, during the whole
time his pen was at work. But the vision had no longer any weakening
or retarding effect upon his brain; rather its effects were quickening and
coercive; and these effects increased, till it became a certainty to him
that from the visible presence of the spirit of Verga he drew the main
strength of his inspiration. The story grew under his pen to an elaborate
romance, upon which, sustained throughout by an elation of mind that
allowed little repose to the body, he was at work during many weeks.</p>

<p class='c028'>In all this time, he never passed beyond the grounds of the villa,
and when, by-and-bye, his face began to show marks of the mental and
bodily stress to which his task subjected him, the peasant people of the
town, who saw him walking in the garden sometimes of an evening, used
to say:</p>

<p class='c028'>“There is the English signor who went to live in the Villa Torcello
eleven weeks ago; he used to go out every day, but it is nine weeks
since he passed the gate. He cannot get out any more. He has seen the
ghost of the Signor Verga, and it keeps him there. He grows like a
ghost himself.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But the story was finished at length, and Gaston sent the manuscript
to his publishers in London. The ghost of Verga, which had remained
visibly before him during the whole period of composition, vanished on
the day the work was ended, and was never seen by him again. He
went out every day as he had done formerly, and exercise brought back
the colour to his face, and restored the tone of his mind. At this time
he thought no more about the story than that it was a strange one,
which had come to him in a strange manner, and that it ought to bring
him the fame in fiction which he coveted.</p>

<p class='c028'>A letter from Sir Selwyn, in which he said that he was on the point
of starting for home, determined Gaston to return thither at once, that
he might have everything in readiness for his father’s coming.</p>

<p class='c028'>On the evening before his departure, while sorting a bundle of papers,
he came upon a portion of manuscript of his story which he remembered
having set aside as needing to be re-cast. He took it up and began to
read it.</p>

<p class='c028'>The tragedy which formed the climax of the romance, had this
feature, that the man who was murdered had (unconsciously, and by a
singular operation of fate) planned his own death in planning that of
the friend whom he falsely believed to have betrayed him in love. The
chapter upon which Gaston had lighted, was devoted to a minute
analysis of the character of the man whom blind force of circumstance
had driven to an act of murder which his affection for its victim had
rendered abhorrent in the highest degree.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>So remote from the ordinary had been the conditions under which
the story was composed, and so small (it had seemed to Gaston) was the
share of its inspiration which his own brain could claim, that now,
within a few weeks of its composition, he read it almost as the work of
another.</p>

<p class='c028'>This exotic notion, that his own was not his own, deepened as he read
further into the chapter, for something was there which disquieted him.
Some shadowy unembodied likeness, and yet no likeness, but a faint
whispering of resemblance; some voiceless hint that was but the
failure of an echo. He turned back, and read again. It was not there,
he had deceived himself. He shut the page, his mind at ease.</p>

<p class='c028'>In a week from this time, he was home again, awaiting the coming of
his father. Sir Selwyn landed in England a month later, and Gaston,
who received him at the vessel’s side, was shocked at his appearance.
Sir Selwyn’s handsome face seemed not so much to have aged as to
have withered; the body, too, was shrunken, and desiccated, as though
the vital fluids were exhausted. The nervous irritation of manner which
had characterised an earlier stage of the disease, had given way to a
species of torpor, in which even speech seemed an effort. It was the
mental and bodily paralysis of melancholia in its acutest form.</p>

<p class='c028'>The journey home was a sad one. What little Sir Selwyn said, told
the story of the renewal of his sufferings, which dated from the day
that he had written to Gaston of his intention to return to England.
“But I am persuaded,” he said in conclusion, “that it draws near the end.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Strangely enough, however, as Gaston thought, and quite contrary to
his expectations, the sight of his beautiful home revived Sir Selwyn’s
spirits. They dined together, and the baronet showed a brighter face
over his wine. He sent for his bailiff, and spent an hour or more
discussing the affairs of his estate. Afterwards, he walked with Gaston
through the gardens and park, and began, for the first time, to talk of
his travels. Then he questioned Gaston about his Italian tour, and
said:</p>

<p class='c028'>“What did you do with yourself all those weeks in Palermo? You
mentioned no writing; but I am sure your pen was not idle so
long.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” said Gaston. “I wrote a famous story there. I did not mean
to tell you of it until it was published. It was to be a surprise, for this
is the book that is to make me famous.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come, that sounds well!” said Sir Selwyn. “But you are beginning
to be famous already. What could have been better than the
reviews of your last book which you sent me?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, but this one will do twice as much for me!” laughed Gaston.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am glad you feel that. No one could be more delighted than I am
to hear it. Have you dedicated it to me, Gaston?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Otherwise, my dear father, it would be no book of mine.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Thank you, Gaston. You know how dear your fame is to me.”</p>

<p class='c035'>In another month, during which Sir Selwyn’s health, with some fluctuations,
had shown, on the whole, a disposition towards improvement,
Gaston’s romance was published.</p>

<p class='c028'>On the day on which some copies were forwarded to him from the
publishers, he had gone on business to the neighbouring town, and did
not return until late in the evening.</p>

<p class='c028'>Sir Selwyn’s valet, an old and devoted servant who had been with
his master for many years, met him at the door, pale, and terrified.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Sir Selwyn has been taken strangely ill, sir,” he said. “We can
none of us tell what is the matter with him. He rang his bell an hour
ago, and when I went upstairs he was looking like a ghost, sitting up
quite stiff in his arm-chair, with one of your new books in his hand. It
seemed like a dead man speaking when he asked how soon you could
return, and said that no doctor was to be sent for. He would not let
me stay with him either, and, indeed, though I’ve known Sir Selwyn
these forty years, I believe I should have been almost afraid to do so
sir, he looked so terrible. I remained close outside; but there’s not
been a sound in his room ever since, sir.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fears which, even in thought, he dared not shape, came like a wave
upon Gaston, as he hurried to his father’s room.</p>

<p class='c028'>Death, or his image, sat there, in Sir Selwyn’s chair; or rather, the
baronet’s aspect, as Gaston beheld him, grey and rigid, was like the
phantom Life-in-Death; as though a corpse had been galvanised for a
moment into a ghastly appearance of life. The jaw had begun to fall
and the eyes were large and glassy; but the regular rising and falling
of the breast showed that mechanical life was not yet extinct. Open on
the ground beside Sir Selwyn lay Gaston’s new romance.</p>

<p class='c028'>The spirit had all but taken its departure; but when Gaston bent
over his father and pleaded for recognition, there was a faint twitching
of the brow, and a half-convulsive movement of the whole body, as
though the spirit were trying to force an entrance again; and Sir
Selwyn, by an effort, fixed his eyes on his son’s face. His voice
struggled in his throat, and he said, with a pause between every
word:</p>

<p class='c028'>“When I knelt beside him—for I still loved him—he said: ‘You
have killed me, but I will never leave you, and one day I will come back
from the grave and kill <em>you</em>’ He has kept his word. This is not your
book, Gaston, <i>it-is-Udalrico’s</i>. This is my——”</p>

<p class='c028'>The voice stopped. Sir Selwyn was dead. The Ghost of Udalrico
Verga was avenged.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE ORIGIN OF EVIL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The problem of the origin of evil can be philosophically approached
only if the archaic Indian formula is taken as the basis of the
argument. Ancient wisdom alone solves the presence of the
universal fiend in a satisfactory way. It attributes the birth of Kosmos
and the evolution of life to the breaking asunder of primordial, manifested
<span class='sc'>Unity</span>, into plurality, or the great illusion of form. <span class='sc'>Homogeneity</span>
having transformed itself into Heterogeneity, contrasts have naturally
been created: hence sprang what we call <span class='sc'>Evil</span>, which thenceforward
reigned supreme in this “Vale of Tears.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Materialistic Western philosophy (so mis-named) has not failed to
profit by this grand metaphysical tenet. Even physical Science, with
Chemistry at its head, has turned its attention of late to the first proposition,
and directs its efforts toward proving on irrefutable data the homogeneity
of primordial matter. But now steps in materialistic Pessimism,
a teaching which is neither philosophy nor science, but only a deluge
of meaningless words. Pessimism, in its latest development, having
ceased to be pantheistic, and having wedded itself to materialism,
prepares to make capital out of the old Indian formula. But the atheistic
pessimist soars no higher than the terrestrial homogeneous plasm of the
Darwinists. For him the <em>ultima thule</em> is earth and matter, and he sees,
beyond the <em>prima materia</em>, only an ugly void, an empty nothingness. Some
of the pessimists attempt to poetize their idea after the manner of the
whitened sepulchres, or the Mexican corpses, whose ghastly cheeks and
lips are thickly covered with rouge. The decay of matter pierces through
the mask of seeming life, all efforts to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c028'>Materialism patronises Indian metaphora and imagery now. In a new
work upon the subject by Dr. Mainländer, “Pessimism and Progress,”
one learns that Indian Pantheism and German Pessimism are <em>identical</em>;
and that it is the breaking up of homogeneous matter into heterogeneous
material, the transition from uniformity to multiformity, which resulted
in so unhappy a universe. Saith Pessimism:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“This (transition) is precisely the original mistake, the <em>primordial sin</em>, which the
whole creation has now to expiate by heavy suffering; it is just that <em>sin</em>, which, having
launched into existence all that lives, plunged it thereby into the abysmal depths of evil
and misery, to escape from which there is but one means possible, <i>i.e.</i>, by putting <em>an
end to being itself</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>This interpretation of the Eastern formula, attributing to it the first
idea of escaping the misery of life by “putting an end to being”—whether
that being is viewed as applicable to the whole Kosmos, or only to individual
life—is a gross misconception. The Eastern pantheist, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>philosophy teaches him to discriminate between Being or <span class='sc'>Esse</span> and conditioned
existence, would hardly indulge in so absurd an idea as the
postulation of such an alternative. He knows he can put an end to <em>form</em>
alone, not to <em>being</em>—and that only on this plane of terrestrial illusion.
True, he knows that by killing out in himself <em>Tanha</em> (the unsatisfied desire
for existence, or the “<em>will</em> to live”)—he will thus gradually escape
the curse of re-birth and <em>conditioned</em> existence. But he knows also that
he cannot kill or “put an end,” even to his own little life except as a
personality, which after all is but a change of dress. And believing but
in One Reality, which is eternal <em>Be-ness</em>, the “<em>causeless</em> <span class='fss'>CAUSE</span>” from
which he has exiled himself unto a world of forms, he regards the temporary
and progressing manifestations of it in the state of <em>Maya</em> (change
or illusion), as the greatest evil, truly; but at the same time as a
process in nature, as unavoidable as are the pangs of birth. It is the only
means by which he can pass from limited and conditioned lives of sorrow
into eternal life, or into that absolute “Be-ness,” which is so graphically
expressed in the Sanskrit word <em>sat</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “Pessimism” of the Hindu or Buddhist Pantheist is metaphysical,
abstruse, and philosophical. The idea that matter and
its Protean manifestations are the source and origin of universal
evil and sorrow is a very old one, though Gautama Buddha was the
first to give to it its definite expression. But the great Indian Reformer
assuredly never meant to make of it a handle for the modern
pessimist to get hold of, or a peg for the materialist to hang his distorted
and pernicious tenets upon! The Sage and Philosopher, who sacrificed
himself for Humanity by <em>living for it, in order to save it</em>, by teaching
men to see in the sensuous existence of matter misery alone, had never
in his deep philosophical mind any idea of offering a premium for
suicide; his efforts were to release mankind from too strong an attachment
to life, which is the chief cause of Selfishness—hence the
creator of mutual pain and suffering. In his personal case, Buddha left
us an example of fortitude to follow: in living, not in running away
from life. His doctrine shows evil immanent, <em>not in matter</em> which is
eternal, but in the illusions created by it: through the changes and
transformations of matter generating life—because these changes are
conditioned and such life is ephemeral. At the same time those
evils are shown to be not only unavoidable, but necessary. For if we
would discern good from evil, light from darkness, and appreciate the
former, we can do so only through the contrasts between the two.
While Buddha’s philosophy points, in its dead-letter meaning, only to the
dark side of things on this illusive plane; its esotericism, the hidden
soul of it, draws the veil aside and reveals to the Arhat all the glories of
<span class='fss'>LIFE ETERNAL</span> in <em>all the Homogeneousness of Consciousness and Being</em>.
Another absurdity, no doubt, in the eyes of materialistic science and
even modern Idealism, yet a <em>fact</em> to the Sage and esoteric Pantheist.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Nevertheless, the root idea that evil is born and generated by the ever
increasing complications of the homogeneous material, which enters into
form and differentiates more and more as that form becomes physically
more perfect, has an esoteric side to it which seems to have never
occurred to the modern pessimist. Its dead-letter aspect, however,
became the subject of speculation with every ancient thinking nation.
Even in India the primitive thought, underlying the formula already
cited, has been disfigured by Sectarianism, and has led to the ritualistic,
purely dogmatic observances of the <em>Hatha Yogis</em>, in contradistinction to
the philosophical Vedantic <em>Raja Yoga</em>. Pagan and Christian exoteric
speculation, and even mediæval monastic asceticism, have extracted all
they could from the originally noble idea, and made it subservient to
their narrow-minded sectarian views. Their false conceptions of matter
have led the Christians from the earliest day to identify woman with
Evil and matter—notwithstanding the worship paid by the Roman
Catholic Church to the Virgin.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the latest application of the misunderstood Indian formula by the
Pessimists in Germany is quite original, and rather unexpected, as we
shall see. To draw any analogy between a highly metaphysical teaching,
and Darwin’s theory of physical evolution would, in itself, seem rather a
hopeless task. The more so as the theory of natural selection does not
preach any conceivable extermination of <em>being</em>, but, on the contrary,
a continuous and ever increasing development of <em>life</em>. Nevertheless,
German ingenuity has contrived, by means of scientific paradoxes
and much sophistry, to give it a semblance of philosophical truth. The
old Indian tenet itself has not escaped litigation at the hands of modern
pessimism. The happy discoverer of the theory, that the origin of evil
dates from the protoplasmic <em>Amœba</em>, which divided itself for procreation,
and thus lost its immaculate homogeneity, has laid claim to the
Aryan archaic formula in his new volume. While extolling its philosophy
and the depth of ancient conceptions, he declares that it ought to
be viewed “as the most profound truth <em>precogitated</em> and <em>robbed</em> by the
ancient sages from modern thought”!!</p>

<p class='c028'>It thus follows that the deeply religious Pantheism of the Hindu and
Buddhist philosopher, and the occasional vagaries of the pessimistic
materialist, are placed on the same level and identified by “modern
thought.” The impassable chasm between the two is ignored. It matters
little, it seems, that the Pantheist, recognising no reality in the manifested
Kosmos, and regarding it as a simple illusion of his senses, has to view
his own existence also as only a bundle of illusions. When, therefore,
he speaks of the means of escaping from the sufferings of objective life,
his view of those sufferings, and his motive for putting an end to existence
are entirely different from those of the pessimistic materialist. For
him, pain as well as sorrow are illusions, due to attachment to this life, and
ignorance. Therefore he strives after eternal, changeless life, and absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>consciousness in the state of Nirvana; whereas the European pessimist,
taking the “evils” of life as <em>realities</em>, aspires when he has the time
to aspire after anything except those said mundane <em>realities</em>, to annihilation
of “being,” as he expresses it. For the philosopher there is
but one real life, <em>Nirvanic bliss</em>, which is a state differing in kind, not in
degree only, from that of any of the planes of consciousness in the
manifested universe. The Pessimist calls “Nirvana” superstition,
and explains it as “cessation of life,” life for him beginning and ending
on earth. The former ignores in his spiritual aspirations even the integral
homogeneous unit, of which the German Pessimist now makes
such capital. He knows of, and believes in only the direct cause of
that unit, eternal and <em>ever living, because the ONE uncreated</em>, or rather
not evoluted. Hence all his efforts are directed toward the speediest
reunion possible with, and return to his <em>pre</em>-primordial condition, after his
pilgrimage through this illusive series of visionary lives, with their unreal
phantasmagoria of sensuous perceptions.</p>

<p class='c028'>Such pantheism can be qualified as “pessimistic” only by a believer
in a personal Providence; by one who contrasts its negation of the
reality of anything “created”—<i>i.e.</i> conditioned and limited—with his own
blind and unphilosophical faith. The Oriental mind does not busy itself
with extracting evil from every radical law and manifestation of life,
and multiplying every phenomenal quantity by the units of very often
imaginary evils: the Eastern Pantheist simply submits to the inevitable,
and tries to blot out from his path in life as many “descents into rebirth”
as he can, by avoiding the creation of new <em>Karmic</em> causes. The
Buddhist philosopher knows that the duration of the series of lives of
every human being—unless he reaches Nirvana “artificially” (“takes
the kingdom of God by violence,” in Kabalistic parlance), is given,
allegorically, in the <em>forty-nine days</em> passed by Gautama the Buddha
under the Bo-tree. And the Hindu sage is aware, in his turn, that he has
to light the <em>first</em>, and extinguish the <em>forty-ninth fire</em><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a> before he reaches
his final deliverance. Knowing this, both sage and philosopher wait
patiently for the natural hour of deliverance; whereas their unlucky
copyist, the European Pessimist, is ever ready to commit, as to preach,
suicide. Ignorant of the numberless heads of the hydra of existences
he is incapable of feeling the same philosophical scorn for life as he
does for death, and of, thereby, following the wise example given him by
his Oriental brother.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus, philosophical pantheism is very different from modern pessimism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>The first is based upon the correct understanding of the
mysteries of being; the latter is in reality only one more system of evil
added by unhealthy fancy to the already large sum of real social evils.
In sober truth it is no philosophy, but simply a systematic slander of life
and being; the bilious utterances of a dyspeptic or an incurable hypochondriac.
No parallel can ever be attempted between the two systems
of thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>The seeds of evil and sorrow were indeed the earliest result and consequence
of the heterogeneity of the manifested universe. Still they
are but an illusion produced by the law of contrasts, which, as described,
is a fundamental law in nature. Neither good nor evil would exist were
it not for the light they mutually throw on each other. <em>Being</em>, under
whatever form, having been observed from the World’s creation to offer
these contrasts, and evil predominating in the universe owing to <em>Ego</em>-ship
or selfishness, the rich Oriental metaphor has pointed to existence as
expiating the mistake of nature; and the human soul (psüche), was
henceforth regarded as the scapegoat and victim of <em>unconscious</em> <span class='sc'>Over-Soul</span>.
But it is not to Pessimism, but to Wisdom that it gave birth.
Ignorance alone is the willing martyr, but knowledge is the master of
natural Pessimism. Gradually, and by the process of heredity or
<em>atavism</em>, the latter became innate in man. It is always present in us,
howsoever latent and silent its voice in the beginning. Amid the early
joys of existence, when we are still full of the vital energies of youth, we
are yet apt, each of us, at the first pang of sorrow, after a failure, or at
the sudden appearance of a black cloud, to accuse <em>life</em> of it; to feel <em>life</em>
a burden, and often to curse our being. This shows pessimism in our
blood, but at the same time the presence of the fruits of ignorance. As
mankind multiplies, and with it suffering—which is the natural result of
an increasing number of units that generate it—sorrow and pain are
intensified. We live in an atmosphere of gloom and despair, but this is
because our eyes are downcast and rivetted to the earth, with all its
physical and grossly material manifestations. If, instead of that, man
proceeding on his life-journey looked—not heavenward, which is but a
figure of speech—but <em>within himself</em> and centred his point of observation
on the <em>inner</em> man, he would soon escape from the coils of the great
serpent of illusion. From the cradle to the grave, his life would then
become supportable and worth living, even in its worst phases.</p>

<p class='c028'>Pessimism—that chronic suspicion of lurking evil everywhere—is thus of
a two-fold nature, and brings fruits of two kinds. It is a natural characteristic
in physical man, and becomes a curse only to the ignorant. It is
a boon to the spiritual; inasmuch as it makes the latter turn into the right
path, and brings him to the discovery of another as fundamental a truth;
namely, that all in this world is only <em>preparatory</em> because transitory.
It is like a chink in the dark prison walls of earth-life, through which
breaks in a ray of light from the eternal home, which, illuminating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the <em>inner</em> senses, whispers to the prisoner in his shell of clay of the origin
and the dual mystery of our being. At the same time, it is a tacit proof
of the presence in man of that <em>which knows, without being told</em>, viz:—that
there is another and a better life, once that the curse of earth-lives is
lived through.</p>

<p class='c028'>This explanation of the problem and origin of evil being, as already
said, of an entirely metaphysical character, has nothing to do with physical
laws. Belonging as it does altogether to the spiritual part of man,
to dabble with it superficially is, therefore, far more dangerous than to
remain ignorant of it. For, as it lies at the very root of Gautama
Buddha’s ethics, and since it has now fallen into the hands of the modern
Philistines of materialism, to confuse the two systems of “pessimistic”
thought can lead but to mental suicide, if it does not lead to worse.</p>

<p class='c028'>Eastern wisdom teaches that spirit has to pass through the ordeal of
incarnation and life, and be baptised with matter before it can reach
experience and knowledge. After which only it receives the baptism of
soul, or self-consciousness, and may return to its original condition of a
god, <em>plus</em> experience, ending with omniscience. In other words, it can
return to the original state of the homogeneity of primordial essence
only through the addition of the fruitage of Karma, which alone is
able to create an absolute <em>conscious</em> deity, removed but one degree
from the absolute <span class='sc'>All</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Even according to the letter of the Bible, evil must have existed
before Adam and Eve, who, therefore, are innocent of the slander of the
original sin. For, had there been no evil or sin before them, there could
exist neither tempting Serpent nor a Tree of Knowledge of <em>good and evil</em>
in Eden. The characteristics of that apple-tree are shown in the verse
when the couple had tasted of its fruit: “The eyes of them both were
opened, and <em>they knew</em>” many things besides knowing they were naked.
Too much knowledge about things of matter is thus rightly shown an
evil.</p>

<p class='c028'>But so it is, and it is our duty to examine and combat the new pernicious
theory. Hitherto, pessimism was kept in the regions of philosophy
and metaphysics, and showed no pretensions to intrude into the
domain of purely physical science, such as Darwinism. The theory of
evolution has become almost universal now, and there is no school (save
the Sunday and missionary schools) where it is not taught, with more or
less modifications from the original programme. On the other hand,
there is no other teaching more abused and taken advantage of than
evolution, especially by the application of its fundamental laws to the solution
of the most compound and abstract problems of man’s many sided
existence. There, where psychology and even philosophy “fear to tread,”
materialistic biology applies its sledge-hammer of superficial analogies,
and prejudged conclusions. Worse than all, claiming man to be only
a higher animal, it maintains this right as undeniably pertaining to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the domain of the science of evolution. Paradoxes in those “domains”
do not rain now, they pour. As “man is the measure of all things,” therefore
is man measured and analyzed by the animal. One German
materialist claims spiritual and psychic evolution as the lawful property
of physiology and biology; the mysteries of embryology and zoology

<p class='c028'>Hitherto pessimism, notwithstanding the abundance and brilliancy of
its paradoxes, had a weak point—namely, the absence of any real and
evident basis for it to rest upon. Its followers had no living, guiding
thought to serve them as a beacon and help them to steer clear of the
sandbanks of life—real and imaginary—so profusely sown by themselves
in the shape of denunciations against life and being. All they could do
was to rely upon their representatives, who occupied their time very ingeniously
if not profitably, in tacking the many and various evils of life to the
metaphysical propositions of great German thinkers, like Schopenhauer
and Hartmann, as small boys tack on coloured tails to the kites of their
elders and rejoice at seeing them launched in the air. But now the programme
will be changed. The Pessimists have found something more
solid and authoritative, if less philosophical, to tack their jeremiads and
dirges to, than the metaphysical <em>kites</em> of Schopenhauer. The day when
they agreed with the views of this philosopher, which pointed at the
Universal <span class='sc'>Will</span> as the perpetrator of all the World-evil, is gone to
return no more. Nor will they be any better satisfied with the hazy
“Unconscious” of von Hartmann. They have been seeking diligently
for a more congenial and less metaphysical soil to build their pessimistic
<em>philosophy</em> upon, and they have been rewarded with success, now that the
cause of Universal Suffering has been discovered by them in the fundamental
laws of physical development. Evil will no longer be allied
with the misty and uncertain Phantom called “<span class='sc'>Will</span>,” but with an
actual and obvious fact: the Pessimists will henceforth be towed by the
Evolutionists.</p>

<p class='c028'>The basic argument of their representative has been given in the
opening sentence of this article. The Universe and all on it appeared
in consequence of the “breaking asunder of <span class='sc'>Unity</span> into <em>Plurality</em>.”
This rather dim rendering of the Indian formula is not made to refer, as
I have shown, in the mind of the Pessimist, to the one Unity, to the
Vedantin abstraction—Parabrahm: otherwise, I should not certainly
have used the words “breaking up.” Nor does it concern itself much
with Mulaprakriti, or the “Veil” of Parabrahm; nor even with the first
manifested primordial matter, except inferentially, as follows from Dr.
Mainländer’s exposition, but chiefly with terrestrial <em>protoplasm</em>. Spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>or deity is entirely ignored in this case; evidently because of the necessity
for showing the whole as “the lawful domain of physical Science.”</p>

<p class='c028'>In short, the time-honoured formula is claimed to have its basis and
to find its justification in the theory that from “a few, perhaps one, single
form of the very simplest nature” (Darwin), “all the different animals
and plants living to-day, and all the organisms that have ever lived on
the earth,” have gradually developed. It is this axiom of Science, we
are told, which justifies and demonstrates the Hindu philosophical <a id='corr116.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='tenet'>tenet.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_116.8'><ins class='correction' title='tenet'>tenet.</ins></a></span>
What is this axiom? Why, it is this: Science teaches that the series of
transformations through which the seed is made to pass—the seed that
grows into a tree, or becomes an <em>ovum</em>, or that which develops into an
animal—consists in every case in nothing but the passage of the fabric
of that seed, from the homogeneous into the heterogeneous or compound
form. This is then the scientific verity which checks the Indian formula
by that of the Evolutionists, identifies both, and thus exalts ancient
wisdom by recognizing it worthy of modern materialistic thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>This philosophical formula is not simply corroborated by the individual
growth and development of isolated species, explains our Pessimist; but
it is demonstrated in general as in detail. It is shown justified in the
evolution and growth of the Universe as well as in that of our planet.
In short, the birth, growth and development of the whole organic world
in its integral totality, are there to demonstrate ancient wisdom. From
the universals down to the particulars, the organic world is discovered to
be subject to the same law of ever increasing elaboration, of the transition
from unity to plurality as “the fundamental formula of the evolution of
life.” Even the growth of nations, of social life, public institutions, the
development of the languages, arts and sciences, all this follows inevitably
and fatally the all-embracing law of “the breaking asunder of unity into
plurality, and the passage of the homogeneous into multiformity.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But while following Indian wisdom, our author exaggerates this
fundamental law in his own way, and distorts it. He brings this
law to bear even on the historical destinies of mankind. He makes
these destinies subservient to, and a proof of, the correctness of
the Indian conception. He maintains that humanity as an integral
whole, in proportion as it develops and progresses in its evolution, and
separates in its parts—each becoming a distinct and independent branch of
the unit—drifts more and more away from its original healthy, harmonious
unity. The complications of social establishment, social relations, as
those of individuality, all lead to the weakening of the vital power, the
relaxation of the energy of feeling, and to the destruction of that integral
unity, without which no inner harmony is possible. The absence of that
harmony generates an inner discord which becomes the cause of the
greatest mental misery. Evil has its roots in the very nature of the
evolution of life and its complications. Every one of its steps forward is
at the same time a step taken toward the dissolution of its energy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>leads to passive apathy. Such is the inevitable result, he says, of every
progressive complication of life; because evolution or development is a
transition from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, a scattering of
the whole into the many, etc. etc. This terrible law is universal and applies
to all creation, from the infinitesimally small up to man for, as he
says, it is a fundamental law of nature.</p>

<p class='c028'>Now, it is just in this one-sided view of physical nature, which the
German author accepts without one single thought as to its spiritual and
psychic aspect, that his school is doomed to certain failure. It is
not a question whether the said law of differentiation and its fatal consequences
may or may not apply, in certain cases, to the growth and
development of the animal species, and even of man; but simply, since it
is the basis and main support of the whole new theory of the Pessimistic
school, whether it is really a <em>universal</em> and fundamental law? We want
to know whether this basic formula of evolution embraces the whole process
of development and growth in its entirety; and whether, indeed, it is
within the domain of physical science or not. If it is “nothing else than
the transition from the homogeneous state to the heterogeneous,” as says
Mainländer, then it remains to be proved that the given process “produces
that complicated combination of tissues and organs which forms and
completes the perfect animal and plant.”</p>

<p class='c028'>As remarked already by some critics on “Pessimism and Progress,”
the German Pessimist does not doubt it for one moment. His supposed
discovery and teaching “rest wholly on his certitude that development
and the fundamental law of the complicated process of organization represent
but one thing: the transformation of unity into plurality.”
Hence the identification of the process with dissolution and decay, and
the weakening of all the forces and energies. Mainländer would be right
in his analogies were this law of the differentiation of the homogeneous
into the heterogeneous to really represent the fundamental law of the
evolution of life. But the idea is quite erroneous—metaphysically as well
as physically. Evolution does not proceed in a straight line; <em>no more</em> than
any other process in nature, but journeys on <em>cyclically</em>, as does all the rest.
The cyclic serpents swallow their tails like the Serpent of Eternity. And
it is in this that the Indian formula, which is a Secret Doctrine teaching,
is indeed corroborated by the natural Sciences, and especially by biology.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is what we read in the “Scientific Letters” by an anonymous
Russian author and critic.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“In the evolution of isolated individuals, in the evolution of the organic world, in that
of the Universe, as in the growth and development of our planet—in short wherever
any of the processes of progressive complexity take place, there we find, apart from
the transition from unity to plurality, and homogeneity to heterogeneity a <em>converse
transformation—the transition from plurality to unity, from the heterogeneous to the
homogeneous</em>.... Minute observation of the given process of progressive complexity
has shown, that what takes place in it is not alone the separation of parts, but
also their mutual absorption.... While one portion of the cells merge into each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>other and unite into one uniform whole, forming muscular fibres, muscular tissue, others
are absorbed in the bone and nerve tissues, etc. etc. The same takes place in the
formation of plants....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>In this case material nature repeats the law that acts in the evolution
of the psychic and the spiritual: both descend but to re-ascend and
merge at the starting-point. <em>The homogeneous formative mass or element
differentiated in its parts, is gradually transformed into the heterogeneous;
then, merging those parts into a harmonious whole, it recommences a converse
process, or reinvolution, and returns as gradually into its primitive or
primordial state.</em></p>

<p class='c028'>Nor does Pessimism find any better support in pure Materialism, as
hitherto the latter has been tinged with a decidedly optimistic bias. Its
leading advocates have, indeed, never hesitated to sneer at the theological
adoration of the “glory of God and all his works.” Büchner
flings a taunt at the pantheist who sees in so “mad and bad” a world
the manifestation of the Absolute. But, on the whole, the materialists
admit a balance of good over evil, perhaps as a buffer against any
“superstitious” tendency to look out and hope for a better one.
Narrow as is their outlook, and limited as is their spiritual horizon, they
yet see no cause to despair of the drift of things in general. The
<em>pantheistic</em> pessimists, however, have never ceased to urge that a despair
of conscious being is the only legitimate outcome of atheistic negation.
This opinion is, of course, axiomatic, or ought to be so. If “in this life
only is there hope,” the tragedy of life is absolutely without any <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison
d’être</i></span> and a perpetuation of the drama is as foolish as it is futile.</p>

<p class='c028'>The fact that the conclusions of pessimism have been at last assimilated
by a certain class of atheistic writers, is a striking feature of the
day, and another sign of the times. It illustrates the truism that the
void created by modern scientific negation cannot and can never be
filled by the cold prospects offered as a <em>solatium</em> to optimists. The
Comtean “enthusiasm of Humanity” is a poor thing enough with
annihilation of the Race to ensue “as the solar fires die slowly out”—if,
indeed, <em>they do die</em> at all—to please physical science at the computed
time. If all present sorrow and suffering, the fierce struggle for existence
and all its attendant horrors, go for nothing in the long run, if
<span class='sc'>Man</span> is a mere ephemeron, the sport of blind forces, why assist in the
perpetuation of the farce. The “ceaseless grind of matter, force and
law,” will but hurry the swarming human millions into eternal oblivion,
and ultimately leave no trace or memory of the past, when things return
to the nebulosity of the fire-mist, whence they emerged. Terrestrial life
is no object in itself. It is overcast with gloom and misery. It does
not seem strange, then, that the Soul-blind negationist should prefer the
pessimism of Schopenhauer to the baseless optimism of Strauss and
his followers, which, in the face of their teachings, reminds one of the
animal spirits of a young donkey, after a good meal of thistles.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>One thing is, however, clear: the absolute necessity for some solution,
which embraces the facts of existence on an optimistic basis.
Modern Society is permeated with an increasing cynicism and honeycombed
with disgust of life. This is the result of an utter ignorance of
the operations of Karma and the nature of Soul-evolution. It is from
a mistaken allegiance to the dogmas of a mechanical and largely spurious
theory of Evolution, that Pessimism has risen to such undue importance.
Once the basis of the Great Law is grasped—and what philosophy can
furnish better means for such a grasp and final solution, than the
esoteric doctrine of the great Indian Sages—there remains no possible
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus standi</i></span> for the recent amendments to the Schopenhauerian system
of thought or the metaphysical subtleties, woven by the “philosopher of
the Unconscious.” The reasonableness of <em>Conscious</em> Existence can be
proved only by the study of the primeval—now esoteric—philosophy.
And it says “there is neither death nor life, for both are illusions; being
(or <em>be-ness</em>) is the only reality.” This paradox was repeated thousands
of ages later by one of the greatest physiologists that ever lived. “Life
is Death” said Claude Bernard. The organism lives because its parts
are ever dying. The survival of the fittest is surely based on this
truism. The life of the superior whole requires the death of the
inferior, the death of the parts depending on and being subservient to it
And, as life is death, so death is life, and the whole great cycle of lives
form but <span class='sc'>one Existence</span>—<em>the worst day of which is on our planet</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>He who <span class='fss'>KNOWS</span> will make the best of it For there is a dawn for
every being, when once freed from illusion and ignorance by
Knowledge; and he will at last proclaim in truth <em>and all Consciousness</em>
to Mahamaya:—</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE GREAT PARADOX.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>Paradox would seem to be the natural language of occultism.
Nay more, it would seem to penetrate deep into the heart of
things, and thus to be inseparable from any attempt to put
into words the truth, the reality which underlies the outward shows
of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>And the paradox is one not in words only, but in action, in the very
conduct of life. The paradoxes of occultism must be lived, not uttered
only. Herein lies a great danger, for it is only too easy to become lost
in the intellectual contemplation of the path, and so to forget that the
road can only be known by treading it.</p>

<p class='c028'>One startling paradox meets the student at the very outset, and
confronts him in ever new and strange shapes at each turn of the road.
Such an one, perchance, has sought the path desiring a guide, a rule of
right for the conduct of his life. He learns that the alpha and the
omega, the beginning and the end of <em>life</em> is selflessness; and he feels the
truth of the saying that only in the profound unconsciousness of self-forgetfulness
can the truth and reality of being reveal itself to his
eager heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>The student learns that this is the one law of occultism, at once the
science and the art of living, the guide to the goal he desires to attain.
He is fired with enthusiasm and enters bravely on the mountain track.
He then finds that his teachers do not encourage his ardent flights
of sentiment; his all-forgetting yearning for the Infinite—on the outer
plane of his actual life and consciousness. At least, if they do not
actually damp his enthusiasm, they set him, as the first and indispensable
task, <em>to conquer and control his body</em>. The student finds that far from
being encouraged to live in the soaring thoughts of his brain,
and to fancy he has reached that ether where is true freedom—to
the forgetting of his body, and his external actions and personality—he
is set down to tasks much nearer earth. All his attention and
watchfulness are required on the outer plane; he must never forget
himself, never lose hold over his body, his mind, his brain. He must
even learn to control the expression of every feature, to check the action
of each muscle, to be master of every slightest involuntary movement.
The daily life around and within him is pointed out as the object of his
study and observation. Instead of forgetting what are usually called the
petty trifles, the little forgetfulnesses, the accidental slips of tongue or
memory, he is forced to become each day more conscious of these lapses,
till at last they seem to poison the air he breathes and stifle him, till he
seems to lose sight and touch of the great world of freedom towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>which he is struggling, till every hour of every day seems full of the
bitter taste of self, and his heart grows sick with pain and the struggle
of despair. And the darkness is rendered yet deeper by the voice
within him, crying ceaselessly, “forget thyself. Beware, lest thou
becomest self-concentrated—and the giant weed of spiritual selfishness
take firm root in thy heart; beware, beware, beware!”</p>

<p class='c028'>The voice stirs his heart to its depths, for he feels that the words are
true. His daily and hourly battle is teaching him that self-centredness
is the root of misery, the cause of pain, and his soul is full of longing
to be free.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus the disciple is torn by doubt. He trusts his teachers, for he
knows that through them speaks the same voice he hears in the silence
of his own heart. But now they utter contradictory words; the one,
the inner voice, bidding him forget himself utterly in the service of
humanity; the other, the spoken word of those from whom he seeks
guidance in his service, bidding him <em>first</em> to conquer his body, his outer
self. And he knows better with every hour how badly he acquits
himself in that battle with the Hydra, and he sees seven heads grow
afresh in place of each one that he has lopped off.</p>

<p class='c028'>At first he oscillates between the two, now obeying the one, now the
other. But soon he learns that this is fruitless. For the sense of freedom
and lightness, which comes at first when he leaves his outer self unwatched,
that he may seek the inner air, soon loses its keenness, and
some sudden shock reveals to him that he has slipped and fallen on the
uphill path. Then, in desperation, he flings himself upon the treacherous
snake of self, and strives to choke it into death; but its ever-moving
coils elude his grasp, the insidious temptations of its glittering scales
blind his vision, and again he becomes involved in the turmoil of the
battle, which gains on him from day to day, and which at last seems to
fill the whole world, and blot out all else beside from his consciousness.
He is face to face with a crushing paradox, the solution of which must
be lived before it can be really understood.</p>

<p class='c028'>In his hours of silent meditation the student will find that there is one
space of silence within him where he can find refuge from thoughts and
desires, from the turmoil of the senses and the delusions of the mind.
By sinking his consciousness deep into his heart he can reach this place—at
first only when he is alone in silence and darkness. But when the
need for the silence has grown great enough, he will turn to seek it even
in the midst of the struggle with self, and he will find it. Only he must
not let go of his outer self, or his body; he must learn to retire into this
citadel when the battle grows fierce, but to do so without losing sight of
the battle; without allowing himself to fancy that by so doing he has
won the victory. That victory is won only when all is silence without as
within the inner citadel. Fighting thus, from within that silence, the
student will find that he has solved the first great paradox.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>But paradox still follows him. When first he thus succeeds in thus
retreating into himself, he seeks there only for refuge from the storm in
his heart. And as he struggles to control the gusts of passion and
desire, he realises more fully what mighty powers he has vowed himself
to conquer. He still feels himself, apart from the silence, nearer akin to
the forces of the storm. How can his puny strength cope with these
tyrants of animal nature?</p>

<p class='c028'>This question is hard to answer in direct words; if, indeed, such an
answer can be given. But analogy may point the way where the solution
may be sought.</p>

<p class='c028'>In breathing we take a certain quantity of air into the lungs, and with
this we can imitate in miniature the mighty wind of heaven. We can
produce a feeble semblance of nature: a tempest in a tea-cup, a gale to
blow and even swamp a paper boat. And we can say: “I do this; it is
my breath.” But we cannot blow our breath against a hurricane, still
less hold the trade winds in our lungs. Yet the powers of heaven are
within us; the nature of the intelligences which guide the world-forces is
blended with our own, and could we realise this and forget our outer
selves, the very winds would be our instruments.</p>

<p class='c028'>So it is in life. While a man clings to his outer self—aye, and even
to any one of the forms he assumes when this “mortal coil” is cast aside—so
long is he trying to blow aside a hurricane with the breath of his
lungs. It is useless and idle such an endeavour; for the great winds of
life must, sooner or later, sweep him away. But if he changes his <a id='corr122.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='altitude'>attitude</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_122.24'><ins class='correction' title='altitude'>attitude</ins></a></span>
<em>in himself</em>, if he acts on the faith that his body, his desires, his
passions, his brain, are not himself, though he has charge of them, and is
responsible for them; if he tries to deal with them as parts of nature,
then he may hope to become one with the great tides of being, and reach
the peaceful place of safe self-forgetfulness at last.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p class='c035'>In a chapel of the great Cathedral in the city there was at certain
hours always a priest who held there his confessional.</p>

<p class='c028'>To him went Hilary some days later. In the interim he had
not seen the Princess. His soul had been torn hither and thither, to and
fro. His passion for the beautiful girl held him fast, while his horror of
the magician repelled him from her. He went to the Cathedral in the
afternoon determined that he would reveal all his distress to the priest.
Father Amyot was in his confessional, but some one was with him, for
the curtain was drawn. Hilary knelt down at the small altar of the
chapel there to wait. Presently there was a slight sound; he turned his
head to see if the confessional was now free. The Princess Fleta stood
beside him, her eyes fixed on him; it was she who at this instant only
had risen from her knees in the confessional. Hilary, amazed and dumb
with wonder, could only gaze upon her. She kept her strange and fascinating
eyes fixed on his for a moment and then turned and with swift,
soft steps left the chapel. Hilary remained kneeling motionless before
the altar, his mind absorbed in what was hardly so much thought as
amazement. Fleta was not then what he thought her. If she were sensitive
to religious impressions she could not be the cold magician which
she had appeared to him to be when he recollected the last scene in the
laboratory. Perhaps after all she used her power generously and for
good. He began to see her in another light. He began to worship her
for her goodness as well as for her strong attractions. His heart leaped
with joy at the thought that her soul was as beautiful as her body. He
rose from his knees and turned instinctively and without thought to follow
her. As he did so he passed Father Amyot, who seeing that no one else
came immediately to the confessional, had left it and flung himself at full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>length upon the ground before the altar. He wore a long robe of coarse
white cloth, tied at the waist with a black cord; a hood of the same cloth
covered his shaven head. He was like a skeleton, perfectly fleshless and
emaciated. His face lay sideways on the stone; he seemed unconscious,
so profound was his abstraction. The eyes were open but had no sight
in them. They were large grey blue eyes, full of a profound melancholy
which gave them an appearance as if tears stood in them. This melancholy
affected Hilary strangely; it touched his heart, made thrill and
vibrate some deeply sensitive cord in his nature. He stood gazing a
moment at the prostrate figure, and then with a profound obeisance left
the chapel.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Princess Fleta had her horse waiting for her. She was a constant
and daring rider, and seldom entered the city except on horseback, to the
amazement of the court ladies, who in the city rode in carriages that they
might dress beautifully. But Fleta had no vanity of this kind. Probably
no other girl of her age would have willingly adopted the hideous dress
of the witch and worn it before so many curious eyes. Her own beauty
and her own appearance was a subject of but the slightest thought to
her. She would walk down the fashionable promenade in her riding
habit among the magnificent toilettes of the Court ladies. This she was
doing now while a servant led her horse up and down. Hilary watched
her from a distance, unable to summon courage to approach her in the
midst of such a throng of personages. But presently Fleta saw him and
came with her swift light step towards him. “Will you walk with me?”
she asked. “There is no one here to be my companion but you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And why is that?” asked Hilary, as with flushed face and eager steps
he accompanied her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Because there are none that sympathise with me. You alone have
entered my laboratory.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“But would not any of these be glad to come if you would admit
them?”</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='corr124.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Not'>“Not</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_124.32'><ins class='correction' title='Not'>“Not</ins></a></span> one would have the courage, except perhaps some few wild
spirits who would dare anything for mere excitement. And they would
not please me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary was silent. Her words showed him very plainly that he
pleased her. But there was a chill in his nature which now asserted
itself. Here in the midst of so many people her hold on him was
lessened, and he doubted her more than ever. Was she merely playing
with him for her own amusement? Her high position gave her this
power and he could not resent it, for even to be her favourite for a day
would be accounted by any man an honour and a thing to boast of.
And Hilary was being signalled out for public honour. He felt the
envious glances of the men whom he met, and immediately a cold veil
fell on his heart. He desired no such envy. To his mind love was a
thing sacred. His scorn of life and doubt of human nature awakened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>at this moment of triumph. He did not speak, but the Princess
answered his thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>“We will go away from here,” she said. “In the country you are a
creature of passion. Here you become a cynic.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How do you know my heart?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c028'>“We were born under the same star,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p class='c028'>“That is no sufficient answer,” he replied. “It conveys no meaning
to me, for I know nothing of the mysterious sciences you study.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come then with me,” she answered, “and I will teach you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She signed to her servant, who brought her horse; she mounted and
rode away with merely a smile to Hilary. She knew that in spite of
the chill that was on him he would hunger for her in her absence and
soon follow. And so he did. The pavements appeared empty though
crowds moved over them; the city seemed lifeless and dull, though it
was one of the gayest in the world. He turned from the streets, and
walking into the country, found himself very soon at the narrow wicket
gate of the Princess Fleta’s Garden House.</p>

<p class='c028'>She was wandering up and down the avenue between the trees. Her
dress was white now, and very long and soft, falling in great folds from
her shoulders. As she moved slowly to and fro, the dancing sunlight
playing on her splendid form, it seemed to Hilary that he saw before
him not a mere woman, but a priestess. Her late visit to the Cathedral
recurred to him; if the religious soul was in her, might she not, indeed,
spite of her strange acts, be no magician, but a priestess? He returned
to his former humour and was ready to worship at her feet. She
greeted him with a smile that thrilled him; her eyes read his very soul,
and her smile brought to it an unutterable joy. She turned and led the
way to the house and Hilary followed her.</p>

<p class='c028'>She opened her laboratory door, and immediately Hilary became
aware of the strong odour of some powerful incense. The dim smoke
was still in the room but the flame had all died away in the vessel. By
the side of the vessel lay a prostrate figure. Hilary uttered a cry of
amazement and of horror as he recognised Father Amyot. He turned
such a look of dismay upon the Princess that she answered his thought
in a haughty tone which she had never before used in addressing him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is not time yet to ask me the meaning of what you may see
here. Some day, perhaps, when you know more, you may have the
right to question me: but not now. See, I can change this appearance
that distresses you, in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She raised the prostrate figure, and flung off from it the white robe
that resembled Father Amyot’s. Beneath, it was clothed in a dull red
garment such as Hilary had first seen it in. With a few swift touches
of her hand the Princess changed the expression of the face. Father
Amyot was gone, and Hilary saw sitting in the chair before him that
unindividualised form and face which at his visit to the laboratory had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>affected him with so much horror. The Princess saw the repugnance
still in his face, and with a laugh opened the screen with which she had
hidden the figure before.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now,” she said, “come and sit beside me on this couch.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But before she left the great vessel she threw in more incense and lit
it. Already Hilary was aware that the fumes of that which had been
already burned had affected his brain. The red figures moved upon the
black wall, and he watched them with fascinated eyes.</p>

<p class='c028'>They shaped themselves together not, this time, into words, but into
forms. And the wall instead of black became bright and luminous. It
was as though Hilary and Fleta sat alone before an immense stage.
They heard the spoken words and saw the gestures and the movements
of these phantasmal actors as clearly and with as much reality as
though they were creatures of flesh and blood before them. It was a
drama of the passions; the chief actors were Hilary and Fleta themselves.
Hilary almost forgot that the real Fleta was at his side, so
absorbed was he in the action of the phantasmal Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>He was bewildered, and he could not understand the meaning of what
he saw, clearly though the drama was enacted in front of him. He saw
the orchard full of blossoming trees; he saw the splendid savage woman.
He knew that he himself and this Fleta at his side, were in some strange
way playing a part under this savage guise; but how or what it was he
could not tell. Fleta laughed as she watched his face. “You do not
know who you are,” she cried. “That is a great loss and makes life
much more difficult. But you will know by and bye if you are willing
to learn. Come, let us look at another and a very different page
of life.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The stage grew dark and moving shadows passed to and fro upon it,
great shadows that filled Hilary’s soul with dread. At last they drew
back and left a luminous space where Fleta herself was visible. Fleta,
in this same human shape that she wore now, yet strangely changed.
She was much older and yet more beautiful; there was a wonderful fire
in her brilliant eyes. On her head was a crown, and Hilary saw that
she had great powers to use or abuse—it was written on her face. Then
something drew his eyes down and he saw a figure lying helpless at her
feet—why was it so still?—it was alive!—yes, but it was bound and
fettered, bound hand and foot.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Are you afraid?” broke out Fleta’s voice with a ring of mocking
laughter in it. “Surely you are not afraid—why should I not reign?
why should you not suffer? You are a cynic; is there anything good
to be expected?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Perhaps not,” said Hilary. “It may be that you are heartless and
false. And yet, as I stand here now, I feel that though you may betray
me by and bye, and take my life and liberty from me, yet I love your
very treachery.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Fleta laughed aloud, and Hilary stood silent, confused by the words
he had spoken hastily without pausing to think whether they were fit to
speak or not. Well, it was done now. He had spoken of his love.
She could refuse ever to see him again and he would go into the outer
darkness.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she said, “I shall not send you away. Do you not know,
Hilary Estanol, that you are my chosen companion? Otherwise would
you be here with me now? The word love does not alarm me; I have
heard it too often. Only I think it very meaningless. Let us put it
aside for the present. If you let yourself love me you must suffer; and
I do not want you to suffer yet. When pain comes to you the youth
will go from your face; you do not know how to preserve it, and I like
your youth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary made no answer. It was not easy to answer such a speech,
and Hilary was not in the humour for accomplishing any thing difficult.
His brain was confused by the fumes of the incense and by the strange
scenes so mysteriously enacted before his eyes. He scarcely knew what
Fleta this was that stood beside him. And yet he knew he loved her
though he distrusted her! With each moment that he passed by her
side he worshipped her more completely, and the disbelief interfered less
and less with his proud joy in being admitted to her intimacy.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now,” said Fleta, “I want you to do a new thing. I want you to
exercise your will and compel my servants who have been pleasing us
with phantasies, to show us a phantasy of your own creation. You can
do this very well, if you will. It only needs that you shall not doubt
you can do it. Ah! how quickly does the act follow the thought!”
She uttered the last words with a little cry of amused pleasure. For the
dim shadows had rapidly masked the stage and then again withdrawn,
leaving the figure of Fleta very clearly visible, beautiful and passionate,
her face alight with love, held clasped in Hilary’s arms, her lips pressed
close to his.</p>

<p class='c028'>The real Fleta who sat beside him rose now with a shake of her head,
and a laugh which was not all gay. The shadows closed instantly over
the stage, and a moment later the illusion was all destroyed and the
solid wall was there before Hilary’s eyes. He had become so accustomed
to witness the marvellous inside this room that he did not pause
to wonder; he followed Fleta as she crossed to the door, and tried to
attract her attention.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Forgive me, my Princess,” he murmured over and over again.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, you are forgiven,” she said at last lightly. “You have not
offended, so it is easy for me to forgive. I do not think a man can help
what is in his heart; at all events, no ordinary man can. And you,
Hilary, have consented to be like the rest. Are you content?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No!” he answered, instantly. And as he spoke he understood for
the first time the fever that had stirred him all through his short bright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>life. “Content! How should I be? Moreover, is not our star the star
of restlessness and action?”</p>

<p class='c028'>For the first time, Fleta turned on him a glance of real tenderness and
emotion. When he said the words “our star,” it seemed as if he had
touched her heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah!” she said, “How sorely I long for a companion!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Then she turned from him very abruptly, and almost before he knew
she had moved she had opened the door, and was standing outside
waiting for him. “Come!” she said impatiently. He followed her
immediately, for he had no choice but to do so; yet he was disappointed.
He was more deeply disappointed when he found that she led
the way with swift steps into the room where her aunt sat. Arrived
there, Fleta threw herself into a chair, took up a great golden fan and
began to fan herself, while she talked about the gossip of the Court. The
change was so sudden that for some moments Hilary could not follow
her. He stood bewildered, till the aunt pushed a low chair towards him;
and he felt then that the old lady was not surprised at his manner, but
only sorry for him. And then suddenly the cynic re-asserted itself in his
heart. A thought that bit like flame suddenly started into life. Had the
bewildered emotion that had been, as he knew, visible on his face, been
seen on others before; was Fleta not only playing with him, but playing
with him as she had played with many another lover? The thought
was more hateful than any he had ever suffered from; it wounded his
vanity, which was more tender and delicate than his heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta gave him no opportunity of anything but talk such as
seemed in her stately presence too trivial to be endured, and so at last
he rose and went his way. Fleta did not accompany him to the gate
this time. She left him to go alone, and he felt as if she had withdrawn
her favour in some degree; and yet perhaps that was foolish, he told himself,
for after all, both he and she had said too much to-day.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta was betrothed. She had been betrothed at her christening.
Before long her marriage would take place; and then that crown seen
in the vision would be placed on her head. Had it needed the vision to
bring that fact to his mind, asked Hilary of himself? If so, ’twas time,
he bitterly added, for Fleta was not a woman who was likely to give up
a crown for the sake of love! His heart rose fiercely within him as he
thought of all this. Why had she tempted him to speak of love? For
surely he never would have dared to so address her had she not tempted
him; so he thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>If he could have seen Fleta now! As soon as he left the room she
had risen and slowly moved back to her laboratory. Entered there, she
drew away a curtain which concealed a large mirror let deep into the
wall. She did this resolutely, yet as if reluctantly. Immediately her
gaze became fixed on the glass. She saw Hilary’s figure within it moving
on his way towards the city. She read his thoughts and his heart. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>last she dropped the curtain with a heavy sigh, and let her arms fall at
her side with a gesture that seemed to mean despair; certainly it meant
deep dejection. And presently some great tears dropped upon the floor
at her feet</p>

<p class='c028'>None, since Fleta was born, had seen her shed tears.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<p class='c035'>Father Amyot on the next morning sent a message to Hilary praying
him to come and see him. This Hilary did at once, and in much perplexity
as to what the reason of such a summons could be. He went
straight to the Cathedral, for there he knew the ascetic priest passed all
his time. He found him, as he expected, prostrate before the altar, and
almost in the same attitude he had seen him in yesterday. Horribly too
it reminded him of the attitude of that figure lying on the floor of Fleta’s
laboratory when he had entered it. He had to touch Father Amyot to
attract his attention; then at once the priest rose and led the way out of
the Cathedral into the cloisters, which joined it to the monastery close at
hand. He went on, without speaking, his head drooped. Hilary could
but follow. At last they reached a bare cell in which was no furniture
but a crucifix and a perpetual lamp burning before it, and against the
wall a bench.</p>

<p class='c028'>Here Father Amyot sat down, and he motioned with his hand to Hilary
to sit beside him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then he fell into a profound reverie; and Hilary watching him, wondered
much what was in his mind. Was Fleta even now working her
spells upon him and moulding his thoughts according to her will?</p>

<p class='c028'>It almost seemed like it, for her name was the first word he uttered
“The Princess Fleta,” he commenced, “is about to go upon a long and
dangerous journey.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary started and turned his face away, for he knew that he had
turned pale. Was she really going to leave the city! How unexpected!
how terrible!</p>

<p class='c028'>“In a very short time,” went on Father Amyot, “the Princess will be
married and she has a mission which she desires to accomplish before her
wedding, and she says that you can assist her in this. It is for the fulfilment
of this mission that she is undertaking the journey I speak of; supposing
you should agree to help her you would have to accompany her.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary made no answer. He had no answer ready. His breath was
taken away and he could not recover it all in an instant. The whole
thing seemed incredible; he felt it to be impossible; and yet a conviction
was already falling on him that it would take place.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Of course,” resumed Father Amyot, seeing that Hilary was not disposed
to speak, “you will want to know your errand, you will want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>know why you are going on this journey. This it will be impossible for
you to know. The Princess does not choose to inform any one of what
her errand is.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Not even the person whom she says can help her?” exclaimed
Hilary in amazement</p>

<p class='c028'>“Not even you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Well,” said Hilary rising with a gesture of indignation, “let her find
some one else to go blindly in her wake. I am not the man.”</p>

<p class='c028'>So saying he walked across the cell to the doorway, forgetting even to
say good-bye to Father Amyot.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the priest’s voice arrested him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You would travel alone, save for one attendant.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary turned and faced the priest in amazement.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, impossible!” he exclaimed, “——yet it is true.”</p>

<p class='c028'>To Hilary the cynic, the thing suddenly assumed an intelligible form.
Fleta wanted to take a journey in which she would prefer a companion
because of its danger; yet she could not give her confidence to any one.
She proposed to herself to use his love for her; she offered him her
society as a bribe to take care of her, to ask no questions and tell no tales.
The idea did not please him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have heard of princesses risking anything, relying on the power of
their position; I have heard that the royal caprice is not to be measured
by the reason of other men and women. Perhaps it is so. But Fleta! I
thought her different even from her own family.”</p>

<p class='c028'>These were the first thoughts that came into his mind. His ready
conclusion was that Fleta was willing that he should be her lover if he
would be her servant also. But immediately afterwards came the fair
vision of Fleta herself in her white robes, and with the face of a priestess.
Her purpose was inscrutable, like herself. He confessed this as he stood
there, surging doubts in his mind. And then suddenly a fragrance came
across his sense—a strong perfume, that he associated with Fleta’s dress—and
next a breath of incense. His brain grew dizzy; he staggered
back and leaned against the wall. He no longer appeared to himself to
be in Father Amyot’s cell—he was in Fleta’s laboratory, and her hand
touched his face, her breath was on his brow. Ah, what madness of joy
to be with her! To travel with her, to be her associate and companion
to pass all the hours of the day by her side. Suddenly he roused himself,
and, starting forward, approached Father Amyot.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will go,” he said.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It will cost you dear,” said the priest. “Think again before you
decide.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is useless to think,” cried Hilary. “Why should I think? I feel—and
to feel is to live.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Father Amyot seemed not to hear his words. He was apparently
already buried in prayer. Evidently he had said all that he intended to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>say; and Hilary, after a glance at him, turned and left the cell. He knew
the priest’s moods too well to speak again, when once that deep cloud of
profound abstraction had descended on his face.</p>

<p class='c028'>He went away, passing back as he had come, through the Cathedral.
At the high altar he paused an instant, and then knelt and murmured a
prayer. It was one he had learned, and he scarce attached any meaning
to the familiar words. But it comforted him to feel that he had prayed,
be it never so meaningless a prayer. For Hilary had been reared in all
the habits of the devout Catholic.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then he went out and took his way towards the Garden House,
walking with long strides. He was determined to know the truth, and
that at once. Amid all the brilliant men who crowded her father’s Court
was he indeed the only one who could touch her heart? An hour ago
he would have laughed at any one who had told him he had touched it;
yet now he believed he had. And what intoxication that belief was!
For the first time he began to feel the absolute infatuation of love. And
looking back it seemed to him that an hour ago he had not loved Fleta—that
he had never loved her till this minute.</p>

<p class='c028'>He found her standing at the gate, among the flowers. She was dressed
in white, and some crimson roses were fastened at her neck. Her face
was like a child’s, full of gaiety and gladness. Hilary’s heart bounded
with the delight it gave him to see her like this. She opened the gate
for him, and together they walked towards the house.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have been to see Father Amyot,” said Hilary. “He sent for me
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” answered Fleta, quietly. “He had a message to you from
me. Are you willing to undertake a tiresome task for one you know so
little?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“My Princess,” murmured Hilary, bending his head as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c028'>“But not your Queen,” said Fleta, with a laugh full of the glorious
insolence only possible to one who had the royal blood in her veins, and
knew that a crown was waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, my Queen,” said Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>“If you call me that,” said Fleta, quickly, and in a different tone, “you
recognise a royalty not recognised by courtiers.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” replied Hilary simply.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The royalty of power,” added Fleta, significantly, and with a penetrating
look into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Call it what you will,” answered Hilary, “you are my Queen. From
this hour I give allegiance.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Be it so,” said Fleta, with a light girlish laugh, “Be ready then, tomorrow
at noon. I will tell you where to meet me. I will send a
message in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Suddenly a recollection crossed Hilary’s mind which had hitherto
been blotted out from it. “My mother,” he said.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Oh,” said Fleta, “I have been to see Madame Estanol. My father
goes into the country to-day and she believes you go with him. She is
glad you should join the Court.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Strange,” said Hilary, unthinkingly, “for she has always set her
face against it.” Then the smile on Fleta’s face made him think his
words foolish.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is as my Queen orders. Seemingly, men and women obey her
even in their inmost hearts.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” said Fleta, with a sigh, “that is just what they do not! It is
that power which I have yet to obtain. They obey me, yes, but against
the dictates of their inmost hearts. If you really loved me, we could
obtain that power; but you are like the others. You do not love me
with your inmost heart!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I do not!” exclaimed Hilary, in amazement, stunned by her words.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she answered, mournfully, “you do not. If you really loved
me you would not calculate chances and risks, you would not consider
whether I am profligate or virtuous, whether I am my father’s daughter
or a child of the stars! I tell you, Hilary Estanol, if you were capable
of loving me truly, you might find your way to the gods with me and
even sit among them. But it is not so with you. You vacillate even in
your love. You cannot give yourself utterly. That means grief to
you, for you cannot find perfect pleasure in a thing which you take
doubtingly and give but by halves. Still you shall travel with me;
and you shall be my companion and friend. There is none other
to whom I would give this chance. How do you think you will
reward me? Oh, I know too well. Go now, but be ready when I send
for you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>So saying she turned and went into the house, leaving him in the
garden. For a few moments he stood there embarrassed, not knowing
which way to turn or what to do. But he was not annoyed or disturbed,
as his vanity might have led him to be at another time, by such
cavalier <a id='corr132.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='treatment'>treatment.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_132.32'><ins class='correction' title='treatment'>treatment.</ins></a></span> He was aghast, horrified. Was this the girl he
loved! this tyrant, this proud spirit, this strange woman, who before he
had wooed her reproached him with not loving her enough! Within
him lurked a conventional spirit, strong under all circumstances, even
those of the most profound emotion, and Fleta’s whole conduct shocked
and distressed that spirit so that it groaned, and more, upbraided him
with his mad love. But the fierce growth of that love could not be
checked. He might suffer because it lived, but he was not strong
enough to kill it.</p>

<p class='c028'>He turned and walked away from the house and slowly returned to
the city. He was ashamed and disheartened. His love seemed to disgrace
him. He had entertained lofty ideas which now were discarded
for ever. For he knew that to-morrow he would start upon a long
journey, the end of which was to him unknown, by the side of a girl whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>he could never marry, yet of whom he was the avowed lover. Well, be
it so. Hilary began to look at these things from a fatalistic point of
view; his weakness led him to shrug his shoulders and say that his fate
was stronger than himself. So he went home gloomily yet with a burning
and feverish heart. He immediately set to work making ready for
his departure for an indefinite period. His mother he found was prepared
for this, as Fleta had told him; and more—seemed to regard Fleta as a
kind of gentle goddess who had brought good fortune into his path.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have always resisted the idea of your hanging about the Court,”
she said, “but it is different if indeed the King wishes to have you with
him. That must lead to your obtaining some honourable post. What I
dreaded was your becoming a mere useless idler. And I am glad you
are going into the country, dear, for you are looking very pale and quite
ill.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary assented tacitly and without comment to the deceit with which
Fleta had paved the way for him.</p>

<p class='c035'>When desire is for the purely abstract—when it has lost all trace or tinge of
“self”—then it has become pure.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first step towards this purity is to kill out the desire for the things of
matter, since these <em>can</em> only be enjoyed by the separated personality.</p>

<p class='c028'>The second is to cease from desiring for oneself even such abstractions as
power, knowledge, love, happiness, or fame; for they are but selfishness
after all.</p>

<p class='c028'>Life itself teaches these lessons; for all such objects of desire are found Dead
Sea fruit in the moment of attainment. This much we learn from experience.
Intuitive perception seizes on the <em>positive</em> truth that satisfaction is attainable
only in the infinite; the will makes that conviction an actual fact of consciousness,
till at last all desire is centred on the Eternal.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THOUGHTS ON THEOSOPHY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>“The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,” this is the keynote
of all true reform. Theosophy is the vehicle of the spirit that
gives life, consequently nothing <em>dogmatic</em> can be truly
<em>theosophical</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is incorrect, therefore, to describe a <em>mere</em> unearthing of dead letter
dogmas as “Theosophic work.”</p>

<p class='c028'>When a word, phrase, or symbol, having been once used for the
purpose of suggesting an idea <em>new</em> to the mind or minds being operated
on, is insisted upon irrespective of the said idea, it becomes a dead
letter dogma and loses its vitalising power, and serves rather as an
obstruction to, than as vehicle of the spirit; but, alas, this <a id='corr134.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>insistance</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_134.12'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>insistance</ins></a></span>
upon the letter is too often carried on under the honoured name of
“Theosophy.”</p>

<p class='c028'>A man cannot acquire an idea <em>new to him</em> unless it <em>grows</em> in his
mind.</p>

<p class='c028'>The mere familiarity with the <em>sound</em> of a word, or a phrase, or the
mere familiarity with the <em>appearance</em> of a symbol, does not, of <em>necessity</em>,
involve the possession of the idea properly associated with the said
word, phrase or symbol. To insist, therefore, on the contrary cannot be
theosophical; but would be better described as <em>un</em>theosophical.</p>

<p class='c028'>It would certainly be theosophical work to point out kindly and
temperately how certain words, phrases and symbols appear to have
been misunderstood or misapplied, how various claims and professions
may be excessive or confused as a consequence of ignorance or vanity,
or both. But it is quite another thing to condemn a man or a body of
men <em>outright</em>, for certain errors in judgment or action; even though
they were the result of vanity, greed or hypocrisy; indeed such wholesale
condemnation would, on the contrary, be untheosophical.</p>

<p class='c028'>The one eternal, immutable law of life alone can judge and condemn
a man absolutely. “Vengeance is <em>mine</em>, saith the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Were I asked how I would dare attempt “to dethrone the gods,
overthrow the temple, destroy the law which feeds the priests and
props the realm; I should answer as the Buddha is made to answer in
the <em>Light of Asia</em>: ‘What thou bidst me keep is form which passes
while the free truth stands; get thee to thy darkness.’”</p>

<p class='c028'>“What good gift hath my brother but it comes from search and
strife (inward) and loving sacrifice.”</p>

<h4 class='c023'>ARE THE TEACHINGS ASCRIBED TO JESUS CONTRADICTORY?</h4>

<p class='c035'>There are none so blind as those who won’t see, excepting those who can’t!</p>

<p class='c028'>In <cite>Light</cite>, for September 10th, there is a letter from Dr. Wyld, who writes as
follows: “In the last number of <cite>Light</cite> there is a quotation from the <cite>Spiritual
Reformer</cite> in which the writer shows the absurdity of the idea that Jesus was not
an historic being. But while thanking the writer for this contribution, I would
take the strongest objection to his assertion that many of Christ’s teachings
are contradictory and mistaken. This is an assertion occasionally made by
Spiritualists, and whenever I have met with it I have asked for evidence of
the assertion, but hitherto I have received none.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But that might surely have been easily supplied. Here, for example, are
a few very direct contradictions in the speaker’s own words. Every one knows
how secret were the teachings in their nature; how secretly they were
conveyed in private places apart; how secretly his secrets were to be kept; and
yet in presence of the High Priest Jesus makes the astounding declaration:
“<em>I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in synagogues; and in
secret spake I nothing.</em>”—John xviii. 20.</p>

<p class='c028'>Jesus, in keeping with the mythical character, is made to claim equality and
identity with the Father. He says (John x. 30), “<em>I and my Father are one</em>;”
but in the same book (John xiv. 28), he says, “<em>The Father is greater than I</em>”—(Cf.
Matthew xxiv. 36.) Again, he claims superiority over his Father.
“<em>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son. As
I hear I judge</em>” (John v. 22, 30). And then in the same gospel he says, “<em>I
judge no man</em>,” (John viii. 15.) “<em>If any man hear my words and believe not,
I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world</em>,” (John xii. 47). Again,
“<em>I am one that bear witness of myself. Though I bear witness of myself,
yet my record is true</em>,” (John viii. 14, 18); which is contradicted by (John v. 31)
“<em>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true</em>.” He says (John v. 33,
34) that “<em>John bare witness unto the truth, but I receive not testimony from
man</em>,” and then tells the disciples, who are supposed to have been men, that
“<em>they also shall bear witness</em>” to or of him (John xv. 27). Again he says,
“<em>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works</em>,”
(Matthew v. 16). But “<em>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be
seen of them</em>.” (Matthew vi. 1).</p>

<p class='c028'>“<em>Resist not evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other also</em>,” (Matthew v. 39); for “<em>all that take the sword, shall
perish with the sword</em>,” (Matthew xxvi. 52). Nevertheless, “<em>He that hath no
sword let him sell his garment and buy one</em>,” (Luke xxii. 36). “<em>I came not to
send Peace but a Sword</em>,” (Matthew x. 34). “<em>Be not afraid of them that kill
the body</em>,” (Luke xii. 4). Nevertheless “<em>Jesus would not walk in Jewry because
the Jews sought to kill him</em>,” (John vii. 1).</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>I merely ask, for the sake of information, are these statements contradictory
or are they not?</p>

<p class='c028'>I will but offer one or two specimens of the more serious and fundamental
contradictions in the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>olla podrida</i></span> of teaching assigned to Jesus. The teaching
of the alleged founder of Christianity in the Gospel according to Matthew
(ch. xix. 12), is that of the Saboi, the self-mutilators, who are still extant as the
Russian Skoptsi<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and who emasculate themselves to save their spermatic souls,
as Origen is reputed to have done. Jesus is made to say, “<i>There are Eunuchs
which made themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake</i>. He that is
able to receive it, let him receive it.” And then in the opening verses of the
very next chapter, the same teacher says, “<em>Suffer little children and forbid them
not, to come unto me; for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven</em>.” But those who
became Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake could not be suffering the
little children to come unto him or to them. They would be forbidding them
to come at all. If the Kingdom of Heaven be <em>such</em> as the children of Eunuchs
it must be non-extant. As Hood’s deaf shopman said of the crackers going off,
there were so many reports he did not know <em>which</em> to believe.</p>

<p class='c028'>And where is the sense of talking so much nonsense about the “Golden
Rule” or the Divine humanity on behalf of one who carried on the blindest
warfare against human nature itself? Who declared that “<em>If any man come to
me and hate not his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and
sisters, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple</em>” (Luke xiv. 26). And who
promised that every follower of his who “<i>left house, or parents, or brethren, or
wife, or children, for the Kingdom of God’s sake should receive manifold more
in the present and in the world to come life everlasting</i>.” Well may the grateful
Musselman cry in his adorations, “<em>Thank God</em> <span class='fss'>OUR</span> <em>Father has no Son!</em>”</p>

<p class='c028'>But, I do not charge these contradictory sayings and teachings to any
personal character. The collectors are but making use of the <em>Kurios</em>, the Lord
of the pre-Christian Mythos, the mystical Christ of the Gnostics, as a puppet
to represent them and their divers doctrines. They make the human image
of a God of Love to be the preacher of everlasting punishment, and the
bearer of a fan with which he fans the fires of hell; a false foreteller of that
which never came to pass, and the forerunner of a fulfilment which did not
follow. In short, they make this Marionette Messiah dance to any particular
tune they play.</p>

<p class='c028'>Jesus is posed as the original revealer of a father in Heaven, whereas the
doctrine of the Divine Fatherhood was taught in three different Egyptian Cults
during some four thousand years previously.</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Wyld implies that I deny the existence of a personal Jesus. That is the
misrepresentation of ignorance. But the sole historical Jesus acknowledged by
me is the only one who was ever known to the Jews, to Celsus, to Epiphanius,
as the descendant of <span class='sc'>Joseph</span> Pandira, he, who according to Irenæus, lived to
be over fifty years of age.</p>

<p class='c028'>This, I admit, was not the kind of Jesus whom the Christians find in the
Gospels and honour as a God.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Gospel histories do not contain the biography of Ben-Pandira, the son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of Joseph. Nor was it intended that they should. Their Jesus is the
mythical Christ, the Horus of 12 years, and the adult Horus of 30 years; the
Lord of the age, Æon or Cycle, who came and went, and was to come again
for those who possessed the Gnosis.</p>

<p class='c028'>Another writer in <cite>Light</cite>, a week earlier, could not understand how any one
can deny the personal existence of the “Historical Christ!”</p>

<p class='c028'>The <em>Historical Christ</em>! You might as well demand our belief in the historical
Chronos—Time, in person—or the historical Ghost, in man or out of him. If
the writer knew anything of the pre-Christian Spiritualism—anything of the true
nature or even the meaning of the name—he would perceive the Historic
Impossibility of the personal Christ. An “Historical Christ” is as much a
nonentity as the historical Mrs. Harris. But, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>cui bono?</i></span> I have no hope in these
matters of any orthodox Christian Spiritualists. They have to learn the primary
lesson, at last, that Historic Christianity was not founded on our facts <em>until it
had buried them</em>! That it was the negation of Gnosticism, the antithesis of
phenomenal Spiritualism. That it substituted faith for facts; a physical resurrection
for a spiritual continuity, and a corporeal Christ for the trans-corporeal
man.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Christian Revelation leaves no room for modern Spiritualism, and they
are logically, truly Christians who reject it! It recognises no other rising again
except at the last day, and then only for the few who believed in Jesus (John vi. 40).
The Christians have no other world but one at the end of this; no other spirits
extant excepting their physical Christ and the devil.</p>

<p class='c028'>People who will see nothing contradictory in direct opposites, no difference
betwixt black and white, but rather the necessary duality of antiphonal truth,
who can accept a misinterpretation of mythology for the Word of God, are of
little account as witnesses for Spiritualism. They who tell a story about the
whale swallowing Jonah are not likely to be credited when they come with
another that looks very like Jonah swallowing the whale. Professed believers in
the literal truth of the Gospel fables are of necessity “<em>Suspects</em>” as witnesses
for abnormal and extraordinary facts.</p>

<p class='c028'>Pointing to his antagonist on the platform, O’Connel once enquired of his
audience, “Can ye believe a single word that a gentleman says who wears a
waistcoat of <em>that</em> colour?” It was yellow, and they couldn’t.</p>

<p class='c028'>What is the use of taking your “Bible oath” that this thing is true, if the
Book you are sworn upon is a magazine of falsehoods already exploded or just
going off?</p>

<p class='c028'>Moreover, the Christian Priesthood has been preaching through all these
centuries that the dead do <em>not</em> return; and the living have believed them.</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Sprenger has calculated that nine million persons have been put to death
as Witches, Wizards, or Mediums, since 1484, when Pope Innocent VIII. issued
his Bull against Spiritualism and all its practices, which were considered to be
the works of the devil.</p>

<p class='c028'>Besides, if the Christian scheme of damnation be true, as assigned to the
teaching of Jesus, no humane person should want to know that there is any
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c028'>Spiritualism can make no headway where it has to draw after it this dead
weight of a tail.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Christian Spiritualism also ostentatiously proclaims that it has nothing in the
world to do with “Woman’s Rights,” “Vaccination,” or any such merely
human interests. It would seek to create an interest in another life, whilst
ignoring the vital interests of this. But that is to sign its own death-warrant
and to seal its own speedy doom. This is to repeat the mistake and follow the
failure of the Christian system of saving souls for another life whilst allowing
them to be damned in this. At the same time, it would drag Spiritualism into
the bankrupt business of Historic Christianity and bind up a third testament to
save the other two, as a sort of Trinity in Unity. But as a system of thought,
of religion, or morals and a mode of interpreting nature, Historic Christianity is
moribund and cannot be saved, or resuscitated by transfusion of new blood into
it; not if you bled Spiritualism to death in trying to give it a little new life.
They try in vain to make our phenomena guarantee the miracles of mythology
as spiritual realities. They try in vain to tether the other world in this and
make it draw for the fraudulent old faith. They keep on jumping up and down
to persuade themselves and others that they are free. But it is only a question
of length of chain, for those who are still fettered fast at foot upon the ancient
standing-ground.</p>

<p class='c028'>I have not answered the writer in the paper quoted by <cite>Light</cite>, and approved
by Dr. Wyld, for the reason that his acquaintance with my data was too limited
to make discussion profitable or useful. Those data are already presented in
accessible books and pamphlets, and there is no need for me to repeat them in
reply to him. Those who undertake to write on so perplexing a subject ought
to be able to illuminate it and enlighten their opponents. The problems are
not to be solved by any amount of personal simplicity. I am always ready to
meet any competent and well-informed defender of the faith upon the platform
or in the press. I should prefer it to be a bishop, who is also an Egyptologist.
But beggars are not allowed to be choosers. I am prepared at any time to
demonstrate the entirely mythical and mystical origin of the Christ, and the
non-spiritual, non-historical beginnings of the vast complex called Christianity.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>TO THE AUTHOR OF “LIGHT ON THE PATH.”</h4>

<p class='c035'>There is a sentence in your “Comments” which has haunted me with a
sense of irritation: “To obtain knowledge by experiment is too tedious a
method for those who aspire to do real work,” &amp;c. Have we any knowledge, of
whatever sort, that has been of use in the world, which has been obtained otherwise
than experimentally? By patient and persistent toil of sifting and testing,
we have obtained the little knowledge that is of service to us. Is there such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>thing as “certain intuition”? Has intuitive knowledge, if such there be, been
accepted as positive knowledge until it has been submitted to the test of experiment?
Would it be right that it should be? Your illustration of the “determined
workman” brings the question down (as I think the question should be
brought) to the plane of practice. Is there any workman who can know his tools
until he has tried them? Is not the history of knowledge the history of intuitions
put to the test of practice? Intuitions, or what we call such, seem to me quite
as apt and likely to deceive us as anything in the world; we only know them
for good when we have tried them.</p>

<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Interrogator.</span></div>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>It seems to me there is some confusion in this letter between obtaining
knowledge by experiment, and testing it by experiment. Edison knew that his
discoveries were only things to look for, and he tested his knowledge by experiment.
The actual work of great inventors is the bringing of intuitive knowledge
on to the plane of practice by applying the test of experiment. But all inventors
are seers; and some of them having died without being able to put into practice
the powers which they knew existed in Nature were considered madmen. Later
on, other men are more fortunate, and re-discover the laughed-at knowledge.
This is an old and familiar story, but we need constantly to be reminded of it.
How often have great musicians or great artists been regarded as “infant
prodigies” in their childhood? They have intuitive knowledge of that power
of which they are chosen interpreters, and experiment is only necessary in
order to find out how to give that which they know to others.</p>

<p class='c028'>Intuitive knowledge in reference to the subjects with which I have been dealing
must indeed be tested by experiment; and it is the whole purpose of
“Light on the Path” itself, and the “Comments” to urge men to test their
knowledge in this way. But the vital difference between this and material
forms of knowledge is that for all occult purposes a man must obtain his own
knowledge before he can use it. There are many subjects of time content to
linger on through æons of slow development, and pass the threshold of eternity
at last by sheer force of the great wheel of life with which they move; possibly
during their interminable noviciate, they may obtain knowledge by experiment
and with well-tested tools. Not so the pioneer, the one who claims his divine
inheritance now. He must work as the great artists, the great inventors have
done; obtain knowledge by intuition, and have such sublime faith in his own
knowledge that his life is readily devoted to testing it.</p>

<p class='c028'>But for this purpose the testing has to be actually done in the astral
life. In a new world, where the use of the senses is a pain, how can the workman
stay to test his tools? The old proverb about the good workman who
never quarrels with them, however bad they are, though of course had he the
choice he would use the best, applies here.</p>

<p class='c028'>As to whether intuitive knowledge exists or no, I can only ask how came
philosophies, metaphysics, mathematics into existence? All these represent
a portion of abstract truth.</p>

<p class='c028'>Before I received this letter the “Comments” for this month were written,
in which, as it happens, I have spoken a great deal about intuitive knowledge.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Therefore, I will now only quote the definition of a philosopher from Plato,
which is given near the end of Book V.,—</p>

<p class='c028'>“I mean by philosopher, the man who is devoted to the acquisition of knowledge,
real knowledge, and not merely inquisitive. The more our citizens
approach this temperament, the better the state will be. True knowledge in its
perfection and its entirety, man cannot attain. But he can attain to a kind of
knowledge of realities, if he has any knowledge at all, because he cannot know
nonentities. Hence his knowledge is half-way between real knowledge and
ignorance, and we must call it opinion.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<h4 class='c023'><i>To the Editors of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</h4>

<p class='c035'>In the interesting and lucid article on “Karma” in your number of September
15th, everything seems to hinge on the theory of re-incarnation. “Very well,”
says the author of that paper, “let us take the principle of re-incarnation for
granted.” But is not this a rather unphilosophical way of handling a subject of
such gravity? Take this or that principle for granted, and you may go about
to prove anything under the sun. It is the old weakness of begging the question.
Is it not this taking for granted what cannot be proved, and is not attempted to
be proved, that has led astray speculators—both scientific and religious—everywhere
and in every age, and is it not upon similar assumptions that the whole
monstrous fabric of theology rests? Of course, in every kind of speculation
one is compelled to set out with an assumption of some sort; but then the first
thing the reader demands is, that the grounds shall be shown upon which the
assumption rests; the assumption, whatever it be, must be made good before
one can be asked to accept that which is to be raised upon it. And here comes
in my question: What is the warrant or sanction for the principle of re-incarnation?
What is the principle grounded upon? Do we undergo re-incarnation,
and how do you know it?</p>

<p class='c028'>Having set out with the assumption, the author does not return to it again,
and at the end of the article I am as uninstructed as at the outset respecting
the pivotal principle upon which all that follows seems to turn.</p>

<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Interrogator.</span></div>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c028'>The author of “Karma” will go into this question fully in a paper devoted
entirely to the subject of re-incarnation. The two subjects are inextricably
interwoven, but it was decided that to treat the two at the same time would
produce too great a confusion, and offer too wide an area of speculation for the
mind to grapple with. Therefore this course was adopted of taking the principle
of re-incarnation for granted. It is possible that the second paper should have
come first, but the two theories stand side by side, not one before the other, so
that the question of precedence was a difficult one. But it is necessary, in view
of this blending of the ideas, that the reader shall have the complete presentation
of both before him, and then draw his conclusions. Therefore indulgence
is asked until the papers dealing with each subject are completed. As many
readers may have felt the same difficulty as our correspondent, we are glad to
insert this letter and reply.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

<p class='c028'>The author of this welcome volume has supplied the present generation of
students of theosophy and occultism with a text-book which has been long
wanted and waited for. The “Zohar” is the great storehouse of the ancient
Hebrew theosophy, supplemented by the philosophical doctrines of the mediæval
Jewish Rabbis. It consists of several distinct yet allied tracts, each discussing
some special branch of the subject; each tract again consists of several portions,
a kernel of most ancient dogma, to which are added comments and explanations,
in some cases by several hands and at very different epochs. There is sufficient
proof that these kernels of dogma are remnants of one of the oldest systems of
philosophy that have come down to us, and they show also intrinsic evidence
that they are associated at least with the return from the Babylonish captivity.
On the other hand, it is pretty certain that the Zohar, in its present form, was
put together and first printed about 1558, at Mantua, and a little later in other
editions at Cremona and Lublin. This Mantuan edition was a revision of the
collection of tracts collected and edited in MS. form by Moses de Leon, of
Guadalaxara, in Spain, about 1300; even the most hostile views of the antiquity
of the Zohar grant this much, and although direct historical evidence is not
forthcoming of the several steps in the course of transmission of these doctrines
from ante-Roman times, yet, as aforesaid, the internal evidence is ample to
show the essential origination of the specially Hebrew ideas found in the Zohar
from Rabbis, more or less tinged with a Babylonish cast, who must have flourished
antecedent to the building of the second Temple. The tradition of the
mediæval Rabbis definitely assigned the authorship to Rabbi Schimeon ben
Jochai, who lived in the reign of the Roman Emperor Titus, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 70-80; and it
is the claim of authorship made on his behalf that the modern critic is so fond
of contesting.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “Zohar,” or “Splendour,” or “Book of Illumination,” and the “Sepher
Yetzirah” are almost the only extant books of the Kabbalah, Qbalah or Cabbala.
The “Kabbalah Denudata” of Knorr von Rosenroth, is a Latin version of the
former, with commentaries by himself and by certain learned Rabbis. No
French and no German translation of the Zohar has ever been published, nor
until the present time has any English version been printed. Eliphaz Levi has,
however, paraphrased a few chapters of the “Book of Concealed Mystery,” and
these have been printed in the <cite>Theosophist</cite>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Some parts of the Zohar are written in pure Hebrew, but a large portion is
in Aramaic Chaldee, and there are passages in other dialects; this variation of
language adds immensely to the difficulties of an accurate translation.</p>

<p class='c028'>Knorr von Rosenroth was a most able and compendious Hebrew savant, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>his translation of much of the Zohar into Latin is a work of established
reputation, and has been, indeed, almost the only means by which the students
of our era have been able to consult Hebraic philosophy. The present
revival of theosophical studies by the English speaking races has created a
demand for the Kabbalah in an English dress, and hence the appearance of
the present work is well timed, and will form an epoch in the history of
occultism; and much good fruit will no doubt be borne by a more intimate
acquaintance with Jewish lore, which will tinge the present tendency to
supremacy of the Sanscrit and Hermetic forms of mysticism. There is much
reason to suppose that an attentive study of each of these forms of knowledge
may lead one to the Hidden Wisdom; but a skilful analogy, and an investigation
into the three forms of dogma on parallel lines will give a breadth of grasp
and a cosmopolitan view of the matter which should lead to a happy solution
of the great problems of life in a speedy and satisfactory manner. The
Kabbalah may, in concise terms, be said to teach the ancient Rabbinical
doctrines of the nature and attributes of the Divinity, the cosmogony of our
universe, the creation of angels and the human soul, the destiny of angels and
men, the dogma of equilibrium, and the transcendental symbolism of the
Hebrew letters and numerals.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Mathers, who is a most patient and persevering student, if not professor,
of mystic lore, is at the same time a first-rate classical scholar, and a
skilful interpreter of the Hebrew tongue, and his translation from the Latin,
varied and improved by his own study of the original Chaldee, has produced
an English version of the Kabbalah Denudata which is eloquent in its construction,
true to its text, and lucid in its abstruseness. For the matter is
abstruse, much of it, and some is practically incomprehensible to the beginner,
to the world in general for certain, and perhaps to every one at the first glance.
But it will be certainly perceived that those very portions which seem most
extravagant at a first reading are just the passages from which later a light will
arise and lead one on to a firm grasp of the subject. To take up this volume
and read at odd moments is a useless and hopeless task; no progress will be
made, at any rate at first, except by thoroughly abstracting one’s individuality
from the things of common life; disappointment can only accompany superficial
reading.</p>

<p class='c028'>Great credit is due to the enterprise of Mr. Redway in publishing this volume,
for which no very extensive sale could have been anticipated; that he has
already distributed a considerable number is matter for congratulation to himself
and to the public. It is hoped that his success will induce him to publish
other volumes of antique lore, of which many yet remain more or less completely
ignored by the present generation.</p>

<p class='c035'>The “Siphra Dtzenioutha,” the “Idra Rabba,” and the “Idra Zuta,” included
in this volume are doubtless three of the most valuable of the tracts of the
Zohar, yet there are others of equal interest. The “Book of the Revolutions of
Souls” is a most curious and mysterious work, and the “Asch Metzareph” is a
treatise on the relations between Theosophy and the oldest alchemical ideas
which are known to exist; it is a work on the Asiatic plane, on the lowest of the
four kabbalistic worlds of Emanation.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Beyond the limits of the Zohar proper, the “Sepher Yetzirah,” is a treatise
which for interest and instruction cannot be surpassed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Mathers supplies us with an introduction to the Qabalah, which stamps
him as a master of the science, and although he refers us on some pages to
Ginsburg (a recognised authority), yet his remarks and explanation are more
deep and thorough than those published in Ginsburg’s little English pamphlet,
and are more discursive and complete. My remarks on the difficulty of our
subject hardly render it necessary for me to insist on the absolute necessity of a
painstaking study of this introduction, which will supply in a great measure the
want of a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de novo</i></span> education in Hebrew, and Hebrew modes of thought and
expression.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Mathers justly insists on the literal rendering of the Hebrew title by
the spelling Qabalah, which is no doubt correct, but lays him open to a charge of
pedantry, which perhaps does not much affect him, since it would only come from
superficial and possibly scoffing critics. The use of the letter Q without its
usual English companion the u is sanctioned and advised, in this connection, by
the learned Max Müller and other Orientalists of repute. To avoid the printing
of Hebrew letters, the publisher has adopted a scheme of printing Hebrew
words in English capital letters (in addition to the mode of pronunciation),
after a method given by the author in tabular form. To the Hebrew scholar
this gives an idea of barbarism, which is painful to the eye and sadly mars the
volume, whilst it only saves the student the task of learning an alphabet of 22
letters. I differ from the author in representing the Hebrew Teth by T, while
depicting the Tau by <span class='sc'>Th.</span>, the reverse would have been a closer imitation of the
sounds. The Introduction includes a learned excursus upon the idea of
“Negative Existence,” in which considerable light is thrown on that difficult
subject; skilful definitions are added concerning the <span class='sc'>Ain</span>, the <span class='sc'>Ain Soph</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Ain Soph Aur</span>, answering in English to Negativity, The Limitless, and
Limitless Light, the first essences of Deity. Several pages are devoted to a clear
description of the Ten Sephiroth, the Numerical Conceptions of Godhead, and
their explanatory titles; the Four Worlds of Emanation, and the component
elements of a Human Soul; the Mysteries of the Hexagram as a type of
Macroprosopus, the Most Holy Ancient One, or God the Father—and the
succeeding mystery of Microprosopus, the Lesser Countenance, typified in the
Pentagram and corresponding to the Christian Personality of the “Son of
God,” are all explained at length. The series of references to the <span class='sc'>Ihvh</span> the
Tetragrammaton, the Concealed Name of unknown pronunciation, form a
valuable dissertation. The book is supplied with nine well executed diagrams,
explanatory of the Sephiroth, the sacred names, essences of the soul, and a
very perfect and complete scheme of the Sephiroth in the four worlds of
emanation associated with the Vision of Ezekiel. Mr. Mathers desires to call
special attention to the differentiation of the Deity in the Emanations, into the
female type in addition to masculine characteristics: note the idealism of the
Superior HE, Binah, the Mother, and the Inferior HE, Malkuth, the Bride of
Microprosopus, the Kingdom of God (the Son of God and his Bride the
Church), note that Genesis i. 26, says “let <em>Us</em> make man in our image,”
“male and female created he them;” the “<em>us</em>” is “Elohim,” a noun in
the plural.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The “Siphra Dtzenioutha,” or “Book of Concealed Mystery,” is the most
difficult of comprehension. Mr. Mathers adds a running commentary of his
own, which proves to be very valuable. It consists of five chapters; in the
first are found references to the Mystical Equilibrium, the worlds of unbalanced
force characterised as the Edomite kings, the Vast Countenance, Theli the
Dragon, the powers of <span class='fss'>IHVH</span>, and the essence of the female power—the Mother.
The second chapter mentions the Beard of Truth, and passes on to define
Microprosopus. The third chapter treats of the Beard of Microprosopus in an
allegorical manner, and of the formation of the Supernal Man. An annotation
follows concerning Prayer, and a curious note on the word <span class='fss'>AMEN!</span> as composed
of <span class='fss'>IHVH</span>, and <span class='fss'>ADNI</span> Adonai or Lord. Chapter IV. treats of the male and female
essences, and has a curious note on the Hebrew letter Hé, speaking of it as
female, and composed of D, Daleth, and I, Jod—a great mystery worthy of
study. Chapter V. speaks of the Supernal Eden, the Heavens, the Earth, the
Waters, the Giants-Nephilim in the earth, wars of the kings, the tree of knowledge
of good and evil, the serpent, and the houses of judgment; so that this
treatise is no less discursive than abstruse.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “Idra Rabba,” or “Greater Holy Assembly,” consisted of ten
Rabbis, of whom Rabbi Schimeon was chief, and the book contains their
several speeches and comments upon the doctrines laid down by Rabbi
Schimeon, on a similar plan to the conversations narrated in the Book of Job.
Twenty-five chapters are occupied with an allegory of the several parts of
Macroprosopus, the type of God the Father; the twenty-sixth concerns the
Edomite kings, the vanished creations; Chapters XXVII. to XLII. are an
allegorical description of Microprosopus, the Son Deity, the V or Vau of the
Tetragrammaton; Chapter XLIII. concerns the Judgments; XLIV., the
Supernal Man; and XLV. is a Conclusion, in narrative form, of the passing
away of three of the ten Rabbis, and the acknowledgment of R. Schimeon as
chief of them all.</p>

<p class='c028'>Very much of this descriptive volume referring to Deity is not only abstruse,
but is, to the modern European, verbiage run wild; yet in this characteristic it is
truly Oriental and Hebrew; some passages remind me very much of the “Song
of Solomon,” there are the same exuberant and flowery outbursts of poetic
imagery.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “Idra Zuta,” or “Lesser Holy Assembly,” is a similar treatise, explanatory
of the Holy powers of the Deity, ascribing honour and power to
Macroprosopus, Microprosopus, <span class='fss'>AIMA</span> the God Mother, and the Bride of God;
with instructive allusions to the Prior Worlds of the so-called Edomite Kings,
and the sexual aspects of Godhead. The work concludes with a narrative of the
death of R. Schimeon and his burial, the whole “Idra” being his last dying
declaration of doctrine.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is noteworthy that the words of the “Smaragdime Tablet of Hermes”—“that
which is below is like that which is above” occur in paragraph 388 of
the Idra Rabba, and are thus introduced, “We have learned through Barietha,
the tradition given forth <em>without</em> the Holy City.” I note also that the Mischna
is mentioned in the Idra Zuta. Want of space compels me to omit all
extracts from this volume, which is a matter of regret, as many passages are
very eloquently written.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>A flaw in this book is the construction of the Index, which should have contained
sub-headings, as well as main headings. Of what value is the entry
“Microprosopus,” followed by eleven lines each of fourteen page-numbers? A
score of references, sub-divided between his characteristics, his relationships, and
his titles would have been of more practical use. With this exception, and
when the abomination of Hebrew in English letters has been tolerated, we must
acknowledge the production of a most valuable theosophical and philosophical
storehouse of ancient Hebrew doctrine, on which Mr. MacGregor Mathers may
be heartily congratulated.</p>

<p class='c035'>“AN ADVENTURE AMONG THE ROSICRUCIANS.”</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>By a Student of Occultism.</span><a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>A strange and original little story, charmingly fantastic, but full of poetic
feeling and, what is more, of deep philosophical and occult truths, for those
who can perceive the ground-work it is built upon. A fresh Eclogue of Virgil
in its first part, descriptive of Alpine scenery in the Tyrol, where the author
“dreamt” his adventure, with “shining glaciers glistening like vast mirrors in
the light of the rising sun,” deep ravines with rushing streams dancing between
the cliffs, blue lakes slumbering among the meadows, and daisy-sprinkled
valleys resting in the shadow of old pine forests.</p>

<p class='c028'>Gradually as the hero of the “Adventure” ascended higher and higher, he
began losing the sense of the world of the real, to pass unconsciously into the
land of waking dreams.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“In these solitudes there is nothing to remind one of the existence of man, except occasionally the
sawed-off trunk of a tree, showing the destructive influence of human activity. In some old, rotten,
and hollow trunks rain-water has collected, sparkling in the sun like little mirrors, such as may be
used by water-nymphs, and around their edges mushrooms are growing, which our imagination
transforms into chairs, tables, and baldachinos for elves and fairies.... No sound could now
be heard, except occasionally the note of a titmouse and the cry of a hawk who rose in long-drawn
spiral motion high up into the air....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Throwing himself upon the moss, he begins watching the play of the water
until it becomes “alive with forms of the most singular shape,” with super-mundane
beings dancing in the spray, “shaking their heads in the sunshine and
throwing off showers of liquid silver from their waving locks.”...</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Their laughter sounded like that of the Falls of <em>Minnehaha</em>, and from the crevices of the rocks
peeped the ugly faces of gnomes and kobolds, watching slyly the fairies.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Then the dreamer asks himself a variety of questions of the most perplexing
nature, except, perhaps, to the materialist, who cuts every psychological problem
as Alexander cleft the Gordian knot....</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is the reason that we imagine such things?” he inquires.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Why do we endow ‘dead’ things with human consciousness and with sensation?... Is
our consciousness merely a product of the organic activity of our physical body, or is it a function
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of the universal life ... within the body? Is our personal consciousness dependent for its
existence on the existence of the physical body, and does it die with it; or is there a spiritual consciousness,
belonging to a higher, immortal, and invisible self of man, temporarily connected with
the organism, but which may exist independently of the latter? If such is the case, if our physical
organism is merely an instrument through which our consciousness acts, then this instrument is <em>not</em>
our real self. If this is true, then our real self is there where our consciousness exists, and may exist
independently of the latter.... Can there be any <em>dead</em> matter in the Universe? Is not even a
stone held together by the ‘cohesion’ of its particles, and attracted to the earth by ‘gravitation’?
But what else is this ‘cohesion’ and ‘gravitation’ but <em>energy</em>, and what is ‘energy’ but the <em>soul</em>,
an interior principle called <em>force</em>, which produces an outward manifestation called <em>matter</em>?...
All things possess life, all things possess soul, and there may be soul-beings ... invisible to
our physical senses, but which may be perceived by our soul.” (p. 19.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The arch-druid of modern Hylo-Idealism, Dr. Lewins, failing to appear to
rudely shake our philosopher out of his unscientific thoughts, a dwarf appears in
his stead. The creature, however, does not warn the dreamer, as that <em>too</em>-learned
<em>Idealist</em> would. He does not tell him that he transcends “the limits of the
anatomy of his conscious Ego,” since “<em>psychosis</em> is now diagnosed by <em>medico-psychological
symptomatology as vesiculo-neurosis in activity</em>,”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> and—as quoth
the raven—“merely this, and nothing more.” But being a <em>cretin</em>, he laughingly
invites him to his “Master.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The hero follows, and finds he is brought to a “theosophical monastery,” in
a hidden valley of the most gorgeous description. Therein he meets, to his
surprise, with adepts of both sexes; for, as he learns later:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“What has intelligence to do with the sex of the body? Where the sexual instincts end, there ends
the influence of the sex.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Meanwhile, he is brought into the presence of a male adept of majestic
appearance, who welcomes and informs him that he is among “The Brothers of
the Golden and Rosy Cross.” He is invited to remain with them for some
time, and see how they live. His permanent residence with them is, however,
objected to. The reasons given for it are as follow:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“There are still too many of the lower and animal elements adhering to your constitution....
They could not resist long the destructive influence of the pure and spiritual air of this place; and,
as you have not yet a sufficient amount of truly spiritual elements in your organism to render it firm
and strong, you would, by remaining here, soon become weak and waste away, like a person in consumption;
you would become miserable instead of being happy, and you would die.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Then follows a philosophical conversation on <span class='sc'>Will</span>, in which the latter, in
individual man, is said to become the stronger if it only uses the universal
Will-Power in Nature, <em>itself remaining passive in the</em> <span class='sc'>Law</span>. This sentence has
to be well understood, lest it should lead the reader into the error of accepting
pure <em>mediumistic passivity</em> as the best thing for spiritual and occult development.
A phenomenon is produced on a passing cloud, into which apparent life is
infused by the Master’s hand, stretched towards it; this is again explained by
showing that <span class='sc'>Life</span> is universal and identical with <span class='sc'>Will</span>. Other phenomena
still more wonderful follow; and they are all explained as being produced
through natural laws, in which science will not believe. The thoughts of the
student are read and answered as though his mind were an opened book. A
lovely garden, full of exotic plants and luxurious palm-trees, into which he is
taken, striking him as something unnatural in the Tyrolean Alps; so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>luxury, moreover, seeming to him to disagree with the ascetic views just
expressed by the adept, he is told forthwith, in answer to his unexpressed
thoughts, that the garden had been erected to make his visit an agreeable one;
and that it was an <em>illusion</em>. “All these trees and plants ... require no
gardeners, ... they cost us nothing but an effort of our imagination”—he
learns.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Surely,” he said, “this rose cannot be an illusion ... or an effect of my
imagination?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” answered the adept ... “but it is a product of the imagination
of Nature, whose processes can be guided by the will of the adept. The whole
world ... is nothing else but a world of the imagination of the <em>Universal
Mind</em>, which is the <em>Creator</em> of forms....”</p>

<p class='c028'>To exemplify the teaching, a Magnolia Tree in full blossom sixty feet high,
standing at a distance, is made to look less and less dense. The green foliage
fades into gray, becomes “more and more shadowy and transparent,” until “it
seemed to be merely the ghost of a tree, and finally disappeared entirely from
view.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Thus” continued the adept, “you see that tree stood in the sphere of my mind as it stood in
yours. We are all living within the sphere of each other’s mind.... The Adept creates his
own images; the ordinary mortal lives in the products of the imagination of others, or the imagination
of nature. We live in the paradise of our own soul ... but the spheres of our souls
are not narrow. They have expanded far beyond the limits of the visible bodies, and will continue to
expand until they become one with the universal Soul....”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The power of the imagination is yet too little known to mankind, else they would better beware
of what they think. If a man thinks a good or an evil thought, that thought calls into existence a
corresponding form or power ... which may assume density and become living ...
and live long after the physical body of the man who created it has died. It will accompany his
soul after death, because <em>the creations are attracted to their creator</em>.” (p. 83.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Scattered hither and thither, through this little volume are pearls of <a id='corr147.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wisdom'>wisdom.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_147.29'><ins class='correction' title='wisdom'>wisdom.</ins></a></span>
For that which is rendered in the shape of dialogue and monologue is the fruit
gathered by the author during a long research in old forgotten and mouldy,
MSS. of the <a id='corr147.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Roscrucians'>Rosicrucians</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_147.32'><ins class='correction' title='Roscrucians'>Rosicrucians</ins></a></span>, or mediæval alchemists, and in the worm-eaten
<em>infoglios</em> of unrecognized, yet great adepts of every age.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus when the author approaches the subject of theosophical retreats or
communities—a dream cherished by many a theosophist—he is answered by
the “Adept” that “the <em>true ascetic is he who lives in the world, surrounded by
its temptations</em>; he in whose soul the animal elements are still active, craving for,
the gratification of their desires and possessing the means for such gratification,
but <em>who by the superior power of his will conquers his animal self</em>. Having
attained that state he may retire from the world.... He expects no
future reward in heaven; for what could heaven offer him except happiness
which he already possesses? He desires no other good, but to create good for
the world.”... Saith the Adept.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“If you could establish theosophical monasteries, where intellectual and spiritual development
would go hand-in-hand, where a new science could be taught, based upon a true knowledge of the
fundamental laws of the universe, and when, at the same time man would be taught how to obtain a
mastery over himself, you would confer the greatest possible benefit upon the world. Such a convent
would afford immense advantage for the advancement of intellectual research.... These
convents would become centres of intelligence....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Then, reading the student’s thoughts:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“You mistake,” he added; “it is not the want of money which prevents us to execute the idea.
It is the impossibility to find the proper kind of people to inhabit the convent after it is established.
Indeed, we would be poor Alchemists if we could not produce gold in any desirable quantity ...
but gold is a curse to mankind, and we do not wish to increase the curse.... Distribute gold
among men, and you will only create craving for more; give them gold, and you will transform
them into devils. No, it is not gold that we need; it is men who thirst after wisdom. <em>There are
thousands who desire knowledge, but few who desire wisdom....</em> Even many of your would-be
Occultists ... have taken up their investigations merely for the purpose of gratifying idle
curiosity, while others desire to pry into the secrets of nature, to obtain knowledge which they desire
to employ for the attainment of selfish ends. Give us men or women who desire nothing else but the
truth, and we will take care of their needs....”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>And then having given a startlingly true picture of modern civilisation, and
explained the occult side of certain things pertaining to knowledge, the Adept
led on the student to his laboratory, where he left him for a few minutes alone.
Then another adept, looking like a monk, joined him, and drew his attention to
some powders, by the fumigations of which the Elementals, or “Spirits of Nature”
could be made to appear. This provoked the student’s curiosity. Sure of his
invulnerability in the matter of tests and temptations, he begged to be allowed
to see these creatures....</p>

<p class='c028'>Suddenly the room looked dim, and the walls of the laboratory disappeared.
He felt he was in the water, light as a feather, dancing on the waves, with the
full moon pouring torrents of light upon the ocean, and the beautiful Isle of
Ceylon appearing in the distance. The melodious sound of female voices
made him espy near to where he was three beautiful female beings. The
Queen of the Undines, the most lovely of the three—for these were the
longed-for Elementals—entices the unwary student to her submarine palace.
He follows her, and, forgetting theosophical convents, Adepts and Occultism,
succumbs to the temptation....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Was it but a dream? It would so appear. For he awakes on the mossy
plot where he had lain to rest in the morning, and from whence he had followed
the dwarf. But how comes it that he finds in his button-hole the exotic lily
given to him by the adept lady, and in his pocket the piece of gold transmuted
in his presence by the “Master”? He rushes home, and finds on the
table of his hotel-room a promised work on “The Secret Symbols of the
Rosicrucians,” and on its fly-leaf a few words in pencil. They ran thus:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“<em>Friend, I regret ... I cannot invite you to visit us again for the present.
He who desires to remain in the peaceful valley must know how to resist
all sensual attractions, even those of the Water Queen. Study ... bring
the circle into the square, mortify the metals.... When you have succeeded we
shall meet again.... I shall be with you when you need me.</em>”</p>

<p class='c028'>The work ends with the quotation from Paul’s Second Epistle to the Corinthians,
where the man caught up into Paradise (whether in the body or out of
the body ... God knoweth) “<em>heard unspeakable words, which it is not
lawful for a man to utter</em>....”</p>

<p class='c028'>The “adventure” is more than worth perusal.</p>

<p class='c028'>This work is a monograph of 20 foolscap folio pages, on the celebrated Isiac
Tablet. It is well and clearly printed in good-sized type on good paper, and
has for frontispiece a well-executed photogravure of the Tablet itself, from a
drawing made by the author some years previously. It is written in the clear
style which distinguishes Dr. Westcott’s writings, and in all quotations chapter
and verse are scrupulously given. Three centuries ago this Tablet greatly exercised
the minds of the learned, and continued to do so till the researches of
modern Egyptologists began to throw some doubt upon its authenticity as a
reliable specimen of ancient Egyptian art; since which time the interest in it has
gradually declined. Undoubtedly occult, as its meaning and symbolism alike are,
we feel that this monograph will be of service to all lovers and students of the
mystical ideas of ancient Egypt. The first thing which strikes the eye of even
the most careless observer is the careful and systematic arrangement of the
figures and emblems in triads, or groups of three, which system of classification
prevailed in the religious symbolism of the Egyptians. The Tablet, again, is
divided by transverse horizontal lines into three principal portions, Upper,
Lower, and Middle, the latter being sub-divided by vertical lines into three parts,
the centre of which is occupied by a throned female figure, flanked on each
side by a triad, of which the central figure in each instance is seated. Thus
the Upper and Lower portions of the Tablet give each a Dodecad sub-divided
into Triads, while the central portion forms a Heptad. This at once corresponds
to the symbolism of the ספר יצירה, <em>Sepher Yetzirah</em>, Chapter
VI., § 3. “The Triad, the Unity which standeth one and alone, the Heptad
divided into Three as opposed to Three and the Centre Mediating between
them, the Twelve which stand in war ... the Unity above the Triad, the
Triad above the Heptad, the Heptad above the Dodecad and they are all
bound together each with each.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Commencing with a description of the Tablet, Dr. Westcott gives as much as
is known of its history, quoting from Kircher, Keysler, Murray, and others. It
appears that it was first discovered in Rome, at a spot where a Temple of Isis
had once stood. After the sack of Rome by the Constable De Bourbon, it fell
into the hands of a smith, who sold it to Cardinal Bembo for a large sum. At
his death it came into the possession of the Dukes of Mantua, at the taking of
which city in 1630, it passed into the hands of Cardinal Pava. It is now in the
Museum of Egyptian Antiquities at Turin. The dimensions are 4 ft. 2 in., by
2 ft. 5½ in. Thus its experiences during the last few centuries have been
rather stormy.</p>

<p class='c028'>After mentioning Æneas De Vico and Pignorius, Dr. Westcott gives us an
extensive digest of the views of Athanasius Kircher, from whose plate in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Œdipus Ægyptiacus” the photogravure at the commencement is taken.
Kircher undoubtedly more nearly grasped the esoteric design of the tablet than
any one except Eliphas Levi, and his attempted explanation marks him alike as
a profound scholar and an advanced mystic, notwithstanding the great
disadvantages with which he had to contend in the utter ignorance of
Egyptology as it is now understood, which prevailed at the date at which he
wrote.</p>

<p class='c028'>Quotations and notes from Montfauçon, Shuckford, Warburton, Jablonski,
Caylus, Banier, Mackenzie, Kenealy, and Winckelman follow the excerpts from
Kircher, and we then come to the views of modern Egyptologists on the
subject, notably those of Professor Le Page Renouf as expressed to Dr
Westcott in person. The reasons they assign for doubting the authenticity of
the Tablet are briefly these:—that they consider the execution of the work
stamps it as a Roman production; that the hieroglyphics will not read so as to
make sense; that the running pattern with the masks would never have been
employed by an Egyptian; and that some of the best known Egyptian deities
are conspicuous by their absence. In answer to these attacks Dr. Westcott
wisely remarks that “it is a gross absurdity to suppose that any man capable of
designing such a tablet, over which immense energy, research, and knowledge
must have been expended, to say nothing of the skill displayed in its execution,
should have wasted his abilities in perpetrating a gigantic hoax; for that is, I
suppose, what some modern writers mean who call it a ‘forgery’; but a <em>forgery</em>
is a <em>deceitful imitation</em>. How it can be called an imitation considering that its
special character is that of being different to any other Stelé or Tablet known is
not clear; and how it can be a deceit is also incomprehensible, since it bears no
name or date purporting to refer it to a definite author or period.”</p>

<p class='c028'>On page 16 Dr. Westcott observes that the Four Genii of the Dead are
conspicuous by their absence, but he seems to overlook their representation in
figure 41 of the Limbus, where the sepulchral vases beneath the couch have, as
usual, the heads of the Genii of the Dead.</p>

<p class='c028'>A quotation, together with a plate from Levi’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Histoire de la Magie,”</span>
follows this, together with a disquisition on the Taro, which has so much
exercised occult students of late. Altogether the book is an extremely
interesting production, and Dr. Westcott puts forward his own views on the
subject with much clearness.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>To meet with a book like this in the last quarter of the nineteenth century is
like meeting a Pterodactyl strolling along the Row in the height of the season.
But more careful perusal, while augmenting the reader’s wonder, mingles with it
a certain respect for the writer’s courage and unflinching logic.</p>

<p class='c028'>Granting his fundamental premiss—the verbal inspiration of the Bible—and
accepting his first principle of interpretation, his argument is at least consistent,
and is weakened by no half-hearted pandering to the facts of experience or the
discoveries of science.</p>

<p class='c028'>To quote Mr. Pember’s primary canon, he assumes—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>I. “That the first chapter of Genesis, equally with those which follow it, is, in its primary meaning,
neither vision nor allegory, but plain history, and must, therefore, be accepted as a literal statement
of facts.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>On this basis he gives an interpretation of Genesis, the main idea of which is
the interposition of “The Interval” between the creation and the “Six Days”
described in the text. During this period the earth was wholly given over to
Satan and his host, and the “Six Days” creation was, according to Mr. Pember,
the restoration and reformation of the world from this chaos of confusion.</p>

<p class='c028'>But space forbids to follow the author into details, since one-half of his
volume is devoted to the subject indicated in its sub-title, and this portion is of
greater interest to readers of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>As an accurate and thorough student of the work of those he condemns, Mr.
Pember stands unrivalled. He has both read and understood a very large part of
the literature of Theosophy and Spiritualism. His quotations are fair and well
chosen, his comments strictly moderate in tone and entirely free from any
personal animus. And these traits are the more surprising since the author has
certainly got the “Powers of the Air” very much on the brain. It is hardly
even a rhetorical expression to say that it is his firm and unshakeable conviction,
that all persons who do not hold the same views of Biblical criticism and
Scriptural exegesis as Mr. Pember, are, to the extent of their difference from
him, serving the Powers of Evil, the Personal Devil, the Antichrist, whose
coming he expects in the very near future.</p>

<p class='c028'>On this point only Mr. Pember does not seem to have the courage of his
opinions; perhaps he does not see, or seeing does not realise, the inevitable
conclusion to which his arguments point. But then he may, after all, take
refuge in the famous <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>credo quia absurdum</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>The author, moreover, is sure to meet with scant sympathy even from the
materialists to whom he is most nearly allied in thought. For he accepts, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en bloc</i></span>,
the phenomena and wonders of spiritualism as of occultism, and never
attempts even to question their reality. Meanwhile, he believes in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>resurrection of the <em>physical body</em> after death, in a physical kingdom of Christ
upon earth, and so on. Indeed, his views are the most remarkable compound
of pure materialism and wholesale acceptance of the psychic and so-called
supernatural that have ever appeared in print.</p>

<p class='c028'>To sum up, a few passages may be quoted to give an idea of the spirit of
Mr. Pember’s treatment of this part of the subject, which at the same time will
be the most telling criticism of his book to the minds of those who have grasped
the ideas of which he speaks.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“... the existence, in all times of the world’s history, of persons with abnormal faculties, initiates of
the great mysteries and depositors of the secrets of antiquity, has been affirmed by a testimony far too
universal and persistent to admit of denial.... He who would be an adept must conform to the
teaching of those demons, predicted leaders of the last apostasy, who forbid to marry, and command
to abstain from meat.”</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes1'></a>“We have never met with a single reported instance of a spirit entering the lower spheres with the
glad tidings, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.” On the contrary, among
Spiritualists, as with Theosophists and Buddhists, sin can be expiated only by personal suffering....
“Sin,” shrieks the familiar of “M. A. Oxon,” “is remediable by repentance and atonement and
reparation personally wrought out in pain and shame, not by coward cries for mercy, and by feigned
assent to statements which ought to create a shudder.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Pember, therefore, believes in vicarious atonement in its crudest form?
He teaches that “repentance and faith” save man <em>from the consequences</em> of his
actions!</p>

<p class='c028'>After describing the “Perfect Way” as “an ecclesiastical compound of
Heathenism” (<em>with a capital H</em>), the author proceeds to expound the doctrine of
reincarnation as therein set forth. Nothing can be fairer or more correct than
this exposition, at the conclusion of which we read:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Jews, Christians, Buddhists and Mahommedans ... will become able to unite in a universal
belief that sin is expiated by transmigrations and in the worship of ‘the Great <a id='corr152.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Goddess'>Goddess’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.28'><ins class='correction' title='Goddess'>Goddess’</ins></a></span>. The
conception of a second league of Babel has been formed in the minds of <a id='corr152.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Theosophists.'>Theosophists.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.29'><ins class='correction' title='Theosophists.'>Theosophists.”</ins></a></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>And even then, would not such a league be better than the sectarian wars,
the religious persecutions, the tests and disabilities which still disfigure
<em>Christendom</em> in the name of religion?</p>

<p class='c028'>Further on the author refers to the occult axiom that “whereas God is I AM,
or positive being, the Devil is NOT, and remarks:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“There is little doubt that the culminations of the Mysteries was the worship of Satan himself...
It would appear, then, that from remote ages, probably from the time when the Nephilim [the fallen
angels of Satan’s Host] were upon earth, there has existed a league with the Prince of Darkness, a
Society of men consciously on the side of Satan, and against the Most High.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The spells by which spirits may be summoned from the unseen are now known to all; and those
unearthly forms which in past times were projected from the void only in the labyrinths, caverns, and
subterranean chambers of the initiated, are now manifesting themselves in many a private drawing-room
and parlour. Men have become enamoured of demons, and ere long will receive the Prince of
the Demons as their God.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Theosophy, says Mr. Pember, will become the creed of the intellectual and
the educated, while Spiritualism influences the masses of mankind. And he
traces the influences of Theosophy and Buddhism in “Broad-Churchism, Universalism,
Comtism, Secularism, and Quietism.” Nay, even under the Temperance
movement he spies the lurking serpent of esoteric teaching and guidance,
and he cites letters from Christian friends complaining that these and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>philanthropic movements are being swamped, and their periodicals occupied by
Theosophists, who work on Buddhist principles.</p>

<p class='c028'>In his concluding chapter, the author sums up a truly formidable array of
evidences to prove that “the advocates of modern thought array themselves
against every principle of the early revelations of the Divine Will,” apparently
since they deny and repudiate the following “cosmic or universal laws”:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c040'>I. The law of the Sabbath.</p>
<p class='c040'>II. The headship of the man over the woman.</p>
<p class='c040'>III. The institution of marriage [<i>i.e.</i>, they practise <em>celibacy</em>].</p>
<p class='c040'>IV. The law of substitution, that life must atone for life, and that without shedding of blood there
is no remission, as taught in type by animal sacrifices. Latter-day philosophers affect
the utmost horror of such a salvation, and will have none of Christ.</p>
<p class='c040'>V. The command to use the flesh of animals as food.</p>
<p class='c040'>VI. The decree that “whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.”</p>
<p class='c040'>VII. The direction to multiply and replenish the earth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The charge of disobedience to such laws as these every mystic will joyfully
admit, with the cry, “Happy will it be for all things living when such laws
shall no longer be obeyed by any living creature.”</p>

<p class='c028'>These laws, the disobedience to which Mr. Pember so much regrets in the
later schools, date from the dark past when man had to form his physical existence
and root it upon the earth. If they are some of the early revelations of
the “Divine Will,” that is no reason why they should rule mankind when its
condition is changed and it is emerging from the darkness of Materialism, and
losing, from its natural growth towards that Divine will, the desire for physical
existence. The Mosaic laws were made by the Jehovah, the God of anger and
cruelty. In spite of the strange inconsistency by which the followers of Jesus
Christ, the teacher of a gentle and sublime faith, read in their churches these
Mosaic laws, yet they are empty words from a past of bloodshed to the humane
or religious man. The occultist professes even more than religion—he dares
to avow himself a follower of the light, an aspirant towards knowledge, and one
who is determined to live the noblest life knowledge can indicate. What to
him are the laws of murder, of the shedding of blood, of marriage and giving in
marriage? It is not his aim to help people the earth, for he desires to lift
himself and others above the craving for earth-life. He commits no murder, for
all men are his brethren, and he no longer recognises the brutal law of the
criminal, by which, when blood is shed, blood must be again shed to wash it
away. He can have no interest either in the straightforward laws of the past, or
the complicated modern law of the present—which permits of many things the
Jews would have been ashamed of. The only law he recognises is that of charity
and justice.</p>

<p class='c028'>There is a charming page in the <em>Introduction</em>, a ring of genuine sorrow for
the failure of certain missionaries in their cowardly attack upon the theosophical
leaders, as refreshing as it is ludicrous. The Jeremiad runs in this wise:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“It would seem that the attack of the Madras Christian College upon Madame Blavatsky has by
no means checked the movement in which she has been so conspicuous an actor, and, apparently,
the failure is nowhere more manifest than in Madras itself. It was confidently predicted that the
High Priestess of Theosophy and Buddhism would not dare to show her face again in that city.
Nevertheless she did so, and ... received a warm welcome, not merely from the members of
the Theosophical societies, but also from the members of the various colleges and from many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>persons. She was conducted in procession from the shore to the Pancheappa Hall, and was there
presented by the students with an address of sympathy and admiration, to which, among other
signatures, were appended those of more than three hundred members of the very Christian College
whose professors had assailed her.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>And he adds, “Satan is now setting in motion intellectual forces which will
be more than a match for the missionaries, if they persist in carrying on the
warfare in the old way.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Too much praise cannot be rendered to Mr. Pember for his fairness and
impersonality. He writes as becomes a scholar and a gentleman, and though
one may smile at his intellectual blindness and stand amazed at the mental
capacity which can digest the views which he maintains, one cannot but respect
his earnestness, his thoroughness, and his mastery of the subject.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>By W. Stewart Ross.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>The poem which gives its name to this volume of ringing verse is, as may
easily be conjectured, the lament of a poet over his love torn from him by
inexorable death.</p>

<p class='c028'>A true instinct has taught the author that it is such hours of agony as this,
such piercing of the heart, such fierce and burning torture, which reveal to the
noble soul capable of intense suffering the inner truths and realities of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>To quote:</p>

      <div class='line in2'>And the signs of Live and Die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>Some passages in this opening poem are instinct with the breath of mysticism,
and rouse a keen desire that Mr. Stewart Ross had become acquainted, in that
period of his life when this book was written, with the wider and grander view
of life as a whole, of its purpose and meaning, of its laws and its realities,
which occultism affords to a mind capable of grasping them.</p>

<p class='c028'>Surely the man who could write:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For death and life are really one.”</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For the mystic Part is gathered</div>

</div>

<p class='c038'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>must have the power to sense the keener air of the subtle life and grasp its
glorious promise.</p>

<p class='c028'>What pilgrim of the path has not felt:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Hard-paced the iron years have gone</div>

      <div class='line'>But of this world my kingdom’s not,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like him of Galilee,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I grasp hands they cannot feel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>See forms they cannot see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>In “Leonore: A Lay of Dipsomania,” one of the most terrible sides of
human life is depicted with a vividness which tortures the reader, and flings a
gloom on the inexorable sweep of life, fitly in keeping with the vision pictured
in “A Nightmare.” A mystic, struggling with the negations of modern science,
battling to assert the intuitive knowledge of his true self against its captious
intellectualisms, speaks through this picture of desolation and decay, protesting
against the disappearance of all that is great and valuable in life under the waves
of oblivion.</p>

<p class='c028'>But no man in whom the spark of true poetic inspiration burns can ever in
the depths of his own heart accept the lifeless, empty, unreal phantom which
materialism offers as the aim, the purpose, the fulfilment of life. We hope,
therefore, that Mr. Stewart Ross will some day give us a volume of poetry in
which his true power and insight will find expression, and which will enroll his
name on the list of those who have given new life to men.</p>

<p class='c028'>The September number contains
several articles of great interest. For
lovers of the wonderful, as for the more
scientifically inclined students of the laws
of psycho-physics, the account given by
Sreenath Chatterjee, of a self-levitating
lama who stayed for some days in his
house, is both interesting and instructive.
It is endorsed by Colonel Olcott and
another independent witness, and bears
evident marks of genuine and careful
observation. Curious and wonderful as
such feats are, however, they have little
to do with Theosophy.</p>

<p class='c028'>To many readers such articles as Mr.
Khandalwala’s “The Bhagavat-Gita and
the Microcosmic Principles” will be far
more attractive. The questions propounded
in this paper have a very important
bearing upon a question which
has recently been a good deal under
discussion, and it is to be hoped that
it will elicit from Mr. Subba Row the
further explanation of his views which is
so much needed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Visconde Figanière continues his
“Esoteric Studies” with some abstruse
but very interesting calculations as to the
composition of the alchemical elements
during various cycles. A page of moral
maxims from the Mahabharata and a
thoughtful paper on the “Kabbalah and
the Microcosm” contribute to make this

employed by the writer, with the intuition
of a true mystic, and many suggestive
gleams of light are thrown on an exceedingly
difficult subject in the course of a
few pages.</p>

<p class='c028'>The idea of re-incarnation is traced by
Mr. Walker in the writings of various
poets: Mr. Johnston contributes an interesting
paper on “Gospels and Upanishads,”
and “Rameses” gives us a charming
allegory under the archaic title of

<p class='c028'>This journal—the French Theosophist—contains
in its September number an
article by Madame Blavatsky on “Misconceptions,”
in which various doctrines
and ideas erroneously connected with
Theosophy are dealt with. M. Barlet
continues his series of articles on “Initiation,”
and the reprint of the Abbé de
Villars’ clever and humorous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Comte de

are neither so numerous nor so varied as
those of the other Theosophical periodicals
already referred to. Lady Caithness advocates,
in the current issue, the theory
that the English nation is descended from
the lost ten tribes of Israel. As the very
existence of these ten tribes is more than
questionable, students must judge for
themselves of the weight of the arguments
advanced; the subject being too extensive
even for comment here.</p>

<p class='c028'>THE SPHINX: “A monthly journal
devoted to proving historically and experimentally
the supersensuous conception of
the world on a monistic basis.” Edited
by Hübbe Schleiden. Dr. J. U. Th.
Griebens Verlag, Leipzig.</p>

<p class='c028'>The October number is a full and
highly instructive one. Dr. Carl du
Prel’s handling of the “Demon of Socrates”
contrasts brilliantly with the lame
and obscure treatment which the same
subject received a while ago at the hands
of a body, which professes to investigate
matters pertaining to the soul and its
activity. Herr Niemann’s proof of the
existence of an esoteric or secret teaching
in the Platonic dialogues is able and
convincing; Mr. Finch contributes a
most interesting article on his observations
among the “Faith-Healers” in
America, and Herr Carl zu Leiningen
pursues his able exposition of the Kabbalistic
doctrine of Souls.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>Three new works on mystic subjects
are shortly to appear from the pen of Dr.
Franz Hartmann, whose valuable book on
Paracelsus is certainly in the hands of
many of our readers.</p>

<p class='c028'>Of these the first, and probably the
most important, is entitled: “THE
SECRET SYMBOLS OF THE
ROSICRUCIANS,” and is to be published
in Boston, U.S.A., by the Occult
Publishing Company. It will contain
numerous plates coloured by hand, giving
accurate transcriptions of symbols and
figures which have hitherto lain buried in
rare, and in some cases, unattainable
manuscripts. The value of the work as a
text-book for students will be much enhanced
by the copious vocabulary which
Dr. Hartmann promises shall accompany
it.</p>

<p class='c028'>The other two will probably be issued
by Mr. Redway; the one being called:
“IN THE PRONAOS OF THE
TEMPLE OF THE R.C.,” and the
other: “THE LIFE OF JEHOSHUA,
THE ADEPT OF NAZARETH: AN
OCCULT STUDY.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is an attempt to dispel the mists
which for many centuries have been
gathering around the person of the supposed
founder of Christianity, and which
have prevented mankind from obtaining a
clear view of the “Redeemer.” It claims to
give an approximately correct account of
his life, his initiation into the Egyptian
mysteries and of his ignominious death
caused by an infuriated mob, excited by
the Pharisees of the temple, who were
bound to destroy his mortal form, because
he had taught the religion of universal
fraternal love and freedom of thought in
opposition to priestcraft and superstition.</p>

<p class='c028'>While the book deals to a certain
extent with the external life of Jehoshua,
as far as its details have become known
by historical researches into sources not
generally known, it especially deals with
his inner life—<i>i.e.</i> his method of thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>The author says: “If we wish to give
a correct picture of the character of a
person, we must try to describe his
thoughts as well as his acts, for the
thought-life of a man constitutes his real
life, while his outward life is merely a
pictorial representation, a shadow of the
actions that are taking place upon the
interior stage of his mind.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“To describe this inner life, a dramatical
representation of the processes going
on in the soul of man will be better
adapted to bring it to our understanding,
than a merely verbal description of character.
This maxim seems to have influenced
those who wrote the accounts
contained in the bible, and who describe
interior processes in allegorical pictures
of events, which may or may not have
taken place on the outward plane. I have
adhered to this plan in describing the
thought-life of Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, but
I have attempted to shape the allegories
contained in this book in such a manner
that the intelligent reader may easily
perceive their true meaning, for I have
made the forms sufficiently transparent,
so that the truths which they are intended
to represent may be easily seen through
the external shell.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Nevertheless, these descriptions are
not mere fancies, but they are based upon
historical facts, and upon information
received from sources whose nature will
be plain to every occultist. The events
described have all actually taken place;
but whether they have wholly or in part
taken place on the external or internal
plane, each intelligent reader is left to
decide for himself.”</p>

    <div>ASTROLOGICAL NOTES—No. 2.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>To the Editor of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>The ancients assigned to the planets
certain signs and degrees, in which they
were essentially dignified, being there
more powerful for good, and less powerful
for evil; these were called their
House, Exaltation, Triplicity, Term, and
Face. Opposite to the first two were
the places where they were essentially
debilitated, being there less powerful for
good and more powerful for evil; these
were called their Detriment and Fall.
Whether the latter three dignities have
three corresponding debilities has not
been stated.</p>

<p class='c028'>To the seven known planets, the
ancients apportioned the twelve zodiacal
signs as their respective houses or chief
dignity, thus: ☉ ruled ♌, and ☽ ruled ♋,
both by day and night; while the remaining
ten signs were divided between
the remaining five planets, each planet
ruling two signs, one by day and the
other by night. But when ♅ and ♆ were
discovered, the question arose where to
place them.</p>

<p class='c028'>A. J. Pearce, the present editor of
<i>Zadkiel’s Almanac</i>, has suggested that,
as they were more remote from ☉ than
was ♄, they should have the same houses
and exaltations as ♄. Raphael dethrones
♄ from ♒, and proclaims that ♅ reigns in
his stead. Both these suggestions involve
serious difficulties, nor do they settle the
question once and for all with regard to
any planets which may yet be discovered.
It seems unlikely that planets of such
diverse natures as ♄, ♅, and ♆ (not to
mention any still more distant planets)
should all bear equal rule in the same two
signs, and to depose ♄ from his throne,
pre-supposes a grave error on the part of
the ancients, whose teaching on this point
has been handed down with complete
unanimity from the dim past: necessitating,
also, a further process of dethronement,
and a further ignoring of the
teachings of antiquity, as further planetary
discoveries are made.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first Raphael (the late R. C.
Smith) rejected the ancient nocturnal
and diurnal division of the Houses and
Triplicities, in which he is followed by his
successor. It appears to me that it is
here that the error, with its consequent
difficulties, first arose; and that by observing
this distinction, ♅ and ♆ easily
find their homes, with room to spare for
their yet undiscovered brethren.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is obvious that Astrology can never
become an even approximately perfect
science, unless we are able in our calculations
to take fully into account the
influence of ♅ and ♆. With this end in
view, I have been endeavouring, in my
leisure moments, to solve the problem.
To a certain extent I have been successful;
and though I have not yet been able
to substantiate all my conclusions as fully
as I could wish, yet I deem it is the
best interests of the Science to make
them now public, that their truth or
falsity may be as speedily as possible
established by the investigations of
astrologers generally.</p>

<p class='c028'>My conclusions are the following: that
the ancient Diurnal and Nocturnal
divisions are quite correct, so that if a
figure is drawn for any time between
sunrise and sunset, the planets which
rule by day the signs on the cusps of
the houses of the significators must be
chiefly, and sometimes exclusively, considered;
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c035'>The Houses of the new planets are, I
believe, these:</p>

<p class='c028'>♒, which is the day-house of ♄, is the
night-house of ♅.</p>

<p class='c028'>♊, which is the day-house of ☿, is the
night-house of ♆.</p>

<p class='c028'>♍, which is the night-house of ☿, is the
<a id='corr158R.43'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dayhouse'>day-house</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_158R.43'><ins class='correction' title='dayhouse'>day-house</ins></a></span> of ♅.</p>

<p class='c028'>♓, which is the night-house of ♃, is the
day-house of ♆.</p>

<p class='c035'>The first two I have verified by horary
figures drawn for the time of an event;
the latter two I consider as highly probable,
but have not yet been able to
thoroughly substantiate them.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>There is an old tradition (<cite>Esoteric
Science in Human History</cite>, p. 180) that
there are 12 principal planets in our solar
system; this leaves 4 more to be discovered.
It will be seen at a glance that
these 4 will fill up the vacant signs, two
planets ruling each sign, one by night
and the other by day. The only alteration
which will then have to be made
will be to consider ☉ to rule ♌ by day
only, and ☽ to rule ♋ by night only;
this, however, will be only in accordance
with nature: moreover, the fact that the
ancients assigned only one house each
to ☉ and ☽, and two to each of the other
planets, denotes some essential astrological
difference between them.</p>

<p class='c028'>With regard to the other essential
dignities, Raphael considers ♏ to be the
exaltation of ♅; I am inclined to believe
♒ to be the exaltation of ♆. In the
Triplicities there is a curious want of
harmony; each, according to the ancients,
being ruled by two planets, one by day
and the other by night, except the watery
triplicity, which is ruled by ♂ only.
There seems to be no reason for this
discrepancy, except the all-powerful one
that there was no other known planet to
share his dominion. I have ascertained
that ♆ has strong dignity in ♏, and conclude
that he rules the watery triplicity,
probably by night. Furthermore, I believe
♅ rules the airy triplicity. As for
the Terms and Faces of the planets,
they also, like the Planetary Hours, require
re-arrangement so as to bring in ♅
and ♆ but in what way this is to be
done, I have not yet been able to discover.</p>

<p class='c028'>I will take this opportunity of saying,
in reply to inquiries, that the best books
for beginners are Raphael’s <cite>Horary
Astrology</cite> for that branch of the Science;
A. J. Pearce’s <cite>Science of the Stars</cite> for
Mundane and Atmospheric Astrology; A.
J. Pearce’s <cite>Text Book of Astrology</cite> for
Nativities, to be worked out by Primary
Directions; and Raphael’s <cite>Guide to
Astrology</cite> for the same, worked out by
Secondary Directions excited by Transits.

</div>

<p class='c048'>THE ESOTERIC VALUE OF CERTAIN WORDS AND DEEDS IN SOCIAL LIFE.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>To Show Anger.</i>—No “<em>cultured</em>” man
or woman will ever show anger in Society.
To check and restrain every sign of annoyance
shows good manners, certainly,
but also considerable achievement in
hypocrisy and dissimulation. There is
an occult side to this rule of good breeding
expressed in an Eastern proverb:
“Trust not the face which never shows
signs of anger, nor the dog that never
barks.” Cold-blooded animals are the
most venomous.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>Non-resistance to Evil.</i>—To brag of
it is to invite all evil-doers to sit upon you.
To practice it openly is to lead people
into the temptation of regarding you as a
coward. Not to resist the evil you have
never created nor merited, to eschew it
yourself, and help others quietly to get
out of its way, is the only wise course
open to the lover of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c035'>“<i>Love Thy Neighbour.</i>”—When a
parson has preached upon this subject,
his pious congregation accepts it as
tacit permission to slander and vilify
their friends and acquaintances in neighbouring
pews.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>International Brotherhood.</i>—When a
Mussulman and a Christian swear mutual
friendship, and pledge themselves to be
brothers, their two formulas differ somewhat.
The Moslem says: “Thy mother
shall be my mother, my father thy father,
my sister thy hand maid, and thou shalt
be my brother.” To which the Christian
answers: “Thy mother and sister shall
be my hand-maidens, thy wife shall be
my wife, and my wife shall be thy dear
sister.”—<em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='c035'><i>Brave as a Lion.</i>—The highest compliment—in
appearance—paid to one’s
courage; a comparison with a bad-smelling
wild-beast—in reality. The recognition,
also, of the superiority of animal over
human bravery, considered as a virtue.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>A Sheep.</i>—A weak, silly fellow, figuratively,
an insulting, contemptuous epithet
among laymen; but one quite flattering
among churchmen, who apply it to “the
people of God” and the members of
their congregations, comparing them to
<em>sheep</em> under the guidance of the lamb.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>The Code of Honour.</i>—In France—to
seduce a wife and kill her husband. There,
offended honour can feel satisfied only
with blood; here, a wound inflicted upon
the offender’s pocket suffices.</p>

<p class='c035'><i>The Duel as a Point of Honour.</i>—The
duel being an institution of Christendom
and civilization, neither the old
Spartans, nor yet the Greeks or Romans
knew of it, as they were only uncivilized
heathens.—(<i>See Schopenhauer.</i>)</p>

<p class='c035'><i>Forgive and Forget.</i>—“We should
freely forgive, but forget rarely,” says
Colton. “I will not be revenged, and
this I owe to my enemy; but I will
<em>remember</em>, and this I owe to myself.”
This is real practical wisdom. It stands
between the ferocious “Eye for eye, and
tooth for tooth” of the Mosaic Law, and
the command to turn the left cheek to
the enemy when he has smitten you on
the right. Is not the latter a direct encouraging
of sin?</p>

<p class='c035'><i>Practical Wisdom.</i>—On the tree of
silence hangs the fruit of peace. The
secret thou wouldst not tell to thine enemy,
tell it not to thy friend.—(<em>Arabic.</em>)</p>

<p class='c035'><i>Civilised Life.</i>—Crowded, noisy and
full of vital power, is modern Society to
the eye of matter; but there is no more
still and silent, empty and dreary desert than
that same Society to the spiritual eye of
the Seer. Its right hand freely and lavishly
bestows ephemeral but costly pleasures,
while the left grasps greedily the leavings
and often grudges the necessities of
show. All our social life is the result and
consequence of that unseen, yet ever
present autocrat and despot, called
<em>Selfishness</em> and <em>Egotism</em>. The strongest
will becomes impotent before the voice
and authority of <em>Self</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. The reader well versed in symbology and theogony is, of course, aware that every
god and goddess of the ancient pantheons is androgynous in his or her genealogy.
Thus our Lucifer, the “Morning Star,” being identical with Venus, is, therefore, the
same as the Chaldean Istar, or the Jewish Astoreth, to whom the Hebrews offered cakes
and buns, addressing her as the Lady of Light and the Queen of Heaven. She is
the “great star,” <em>Wormwood</em>, whom the misanthropical St. John sees falling down to
the earth in <cite>Revelation</cite> (Chapter viii.), as her great rival is <em>Aima</em>, the fruitful mother,
or the third Sephiroth Binah (<span class='fss'>IHVH ALHIM</span>, or the female Jah-hovah), the “woman with

<p class='c028'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. It is curious to note that Mr. Louis Stevenson, one of the most powerful of our
imaginative writers, stated recently to a reporter that he is in the habit of constructing
the plots of his tales in <em>dreams</em>, and among others that of Dr. Jekyll. “I dreamed,”
he continued, “the story of ‘Olalla’ ... and I have at the present moment two
unwritten stories which I have likewise dreamed.... Even when fast asleep I
know that it is I who am inventing.”... But who knows whether the idea of
“invention” is not also “a dream”!</p>

But the Theosophist who has read “Esoteric Buddhism” may compute the 7 by 7 of

<p class='c028'>“Surely one of the purest and least self-incrusted duties of man, is to
alleviate the sufferings of his fellow man?</p>

<p class='c028'>“From what I read, and from what I daily come into immediate
contact with, I can hardly think it would be possible to over-rate in
contemplation, the intense privation and agonizing suffering that is—aye,

<p class='c028'>“If one of our main duties is that of exercising disinterested love
towards the Brotherhood, surely ‘those more learned’ ones, whether in
the flesh, or out of it, can and will, if appealed to by their votaries, aid
them in discovering ways and means for such an end, and in organising
some great fraternal scheme for dealing <em>rightly</em> with questions which
are so appalling in their complexity, and which must and do press with
such irresistible force upon all those who are earnest in their endeavours
to carry out the will of Christ in a Christian Land?</p>

<p class='c028'>“October 25, 1887.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>This honest-spoken and sincere letter contains two statements; an
implied accusation against “Theosophy” (<i>i.e.</i> the Society of that name),
and a virtual admission that Christianity—or, again, rather its ritualistic
and dogmatic religions—deserve the same and even a sterner rebuke.
For if “Theosophy,” represented by its professors, merits on external
appearance the reproach that so far it has failed to transfer divine wisdom
from the region of the metaphysical into that of practical work,
“Christianity,” that is, merely professing Christians, churchmen and
laymen lie under a like accusation, evidently. “Theosophy” has, certainly,
failed to discover <em>infallible</em> ways and means of bringing all its
votaries to exercise “disinterested love” in their Brotherhood; it has
not yet been able to relieve suffering in mankind at large; but neither
has Christianity. And not even the writer of the above letter, nor any
one else, can show sufficient excuse for the Christians in this respect.
Thus the admission that “those who are earnest in their endeavour to
carry out the will of Christ in a Christian land” <em>need the help of</em> “‘those
more learned,’ whether (pagan adepts) in flesh, or (spirits?) out of it” is
very suggestive, for it contains the defence and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> of the
Theosophical Society. Tacit though it is, once that it comes from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>pen of a sincere Christian, one who longs to learn some practical means
to relieve the sufferings of the starving multitudes—this admission
becomes the greatest and most complete justification for the existence of
the Theosophical Brotherhood; a full confession of the absolute necessity
for such a body independent of, and untrammelled by, any enchaining
dogmas, and it points out at the same time the signal failure of Christianity
to accomplish the desired results.</p>

<p class='c028'>Truly said Coleridge that “good works may exist <em>without</em> saving (?)
principles, therefore cannot contain in themselves the principles of
salvation; but saving principles never did, never can exist without good
works.” Theosophists admit the definition, and disagree with the
Christians only as to the nature of these “saving principles.” The
Church (or churches) maintain that the only saving principle is belief in
Jesus, or the carnalized Christ of the soul-killing dogma; theosophy,
undogmatic and unsectarian, answers, it is not so. The only <em>saving</em>
principle dwells in man himself, and has never dwelt outside of his
immortal divine self; <i>i.e.</i> it is the true Christos, as it is the true Buddha,
the divine inward light which proceeds from the eternal unmanifesting
unknown <span class='fss'>ALL</span>. And this light <em>can only be made known by its works</em>—<em>faith</em>
in it having to remain ever blind in all, save in the man himself
who feels that light within his soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore, the tacit admission of the author of the above letter covers
another point of great importance. The writer seems to have felt that
which many, among those who strive to help the suffering, have felt and
expressed. The creeds of the churches fail to supply the <em>intellectual</em>
light, and the true wisdom which are needed to make the practical
philanthropy carried out, by the true and earnest followers of Christ, a
<em>reality</em>. The “practical” people either go on “doing good” unintelligently,
and thus often do harm instead; or, appalled by the awful
problem before them, and failing to find in their “churches” any clue, or
a hope of solution, they retire from the battlefield and let themselves
be drifted blindly by the current in which they happen to be born.</p>

<p class='c028'>Of late it has become the fashion for friends, as well as for foes, to
reproach the Theosophical Society with doing no practical work, but
losing itself in the clouds of metaphysics. Metaphysicians, we are
told, by those who like to repeat stale arguments, have been learning
their lesson for the last few thousand years; and it is now high time
that they should begin to do some practical work. Agreed; but considering
that the Christian churches count nearly nineteen centuries of
existence, and that the Theosophical Society and Brotherhood is a body
hardly twelve years old; considering again that the Christian churches
roll in fabulous wealth, and number their adherents by hundreds of
millions, whereas the Theosophical Brotherhood is but a few thousand
strong, and that it has no fund, or funds, at its disposal, but that 98 per
cent. of its members are as poor and as uninfluential as the aristocracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of the Christian church is rich and powerful; taking all this into consideration,
there would be much to say if the theosophists would only
choose to press the matter upon the public notice. Meanwhile, as
the bitterest critics of the “leaders” of the Theosophical Society are
by no means only outsiders, but as there are members of that society
<a id='corr164.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='who who'>who</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_164.6'><ins class='correction' title='who who'>who</ins></a></span> always find a pretext to be dissatisfied, we ask: Can works of
charity that will be known among men be accomplished without money?
Certainly not. And yet, notwithstanding all this, none of its (European)
members, except a few devoted officers in charge of societies, will do
<em>practical</em> work; but some of them, those especially who have never lifted
a finger to relieve suffering, and help their outside, poorer brothers, are
those who talk the most loudly, and are the bitterest in their denunciations
of the <em>unspirituality</em> and the unfitness of the “leaders of
theosophy.” By this they remove themselves into the outer ring of
critics, like those spectators at the play who laugh at an actor passably
representing Hamlet, while they themselves could not walk on to the stage
with a letter on a salver. While in India, comparatively poor theosophists
have opened gratuitous dispensaries for the sick, hospitals, schools, and
everything they could think of, asking no returns from the poor, as the
missionaries do, no abandonment of one’s forefathers’ religion, as a
heavy price for favours received, have the English theosophists, as a rule,
done a single thing for those suffering multitudes, whose pitiful cry rings
throughout the whole Heavens as a protest against the actual state of
things in Christendom?</p>

<p class='c028'>We take this opportunity of saying, in reply to others as much as to
our correspondent, that, up till now, the energies of the Society have
been chiefly occupied in organising, extending, and solidifying the
Society itself, which work has taxed its time, energies, and resources to
such an extent as to leave it far less powerful for practical charity than
we would have wished. But, even so, compared with the influence and
the funds at the disposal of the Society, its work in practical charity, if
less widely known, will certainly bear favourable comparison with that
of professing Christians, with their enormous resources in money,
workers, and opportunities of all kinds. It must not be forgotten that
practical charity is not one of the <em>declared</em> objects of the Society. It
goes without saying, and needs no “declaration,” that every member of
the Society must be practically philanthropic if he be a theosophist at
all; and our declared work is, in reality, more important and more
efficacious than work in the every-day plane which bears more evident
and immediate fruit, for the direct effect of an appreciation of theosophy
is to make those charitable who were not so before. Theosophy creates
the charity which afterwards, and of its own accord, makes itself
manifest in works.</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes2'></a>Theosophy is correctly—though in this particular case, it is rather
ironically—termed “a High, Heaven-born Religion.” It is argued that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>since it professes to receive its advanced knowledge and light from
“those more learned in the Science of Life,” the latter ought and <em>must</em>, if
appealed to by their votaries (the theosophists), aid them in discovering
ways and means, in organising some great fraternal scheme,” etc.</p>

<p class='c028'>The scheme was planned, and the rules and laws to guide such a
practical brotherhood, have been given by those “more learned in the
Science of (practical, daily, <em>altruistic</em>) life;” aye, verily “more learned” in
it than any other men since the days of Gautama Buddha and the Gnostic
Essenes. The “scheme” dates back to the year when the Theosophical
Society was founded. Let anyone read its wise and noble laws
embodied to this day in the Statutes of the Fraternity, and judge for
himself whether, if carried out rigorously and applied to practical life,
the “scheme” would not have proved the most beneficent to mankind
in general, and especially to our poorer brethren, of “the starving multitudes.”
Theosophy teaches the spirit of “non-separateness,” the
evanescence and illusion of human creeds and dogma, hence, inculcates
<i>universal love and charity for all mankind “without distinction of race,
colour, caste or creed;”</i> is it not therefore the fittest to alleviate the sufferings
of mankind? No true theosophist would refuse admission into a
hospital, or any charitable establishment, to any man, woman or child,
under the pretext that he is <em>not</em> a theosophist, as a Roman Catholic would
when dealing with a Protestant, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>. No true theosophist of
the original rules would fail to put into practice the parable of the “Good
Samaritan,” or proffer help only to entice the unwary who, he hopes,
will become a pervert from his god and the gods of his forefathers.
None would slander his brother, none let a needy man go unhelped, none
offer fine talk instead of practical love and charity.</p>

<p class='c028'>Is it then the fault of Theosophy, any more than it is the fault of the
Christ-teachings, if the majority of the members of the Theosophical
Society, often changing their philosophical and religious views upon
entering our Body, have yet remained practically the same as they
were when professing <em>lip</em> Christianity? Our laws and rules are the same
as given to us from the beginning; it is the general members of the Society
who have allowed them to become virtually <em>obsolete</em>. Those few who
are ever ready to sacrifice their time and labour to work for the poor, and
who do, unrecognised and unthanked for it, good work wherever they can,
are often too poor themselves to put their larger schemes of charity
into objective practical form, however willing they may be.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The fault I find with the Theosophical Society,” said one of the most
eminent surgeons in London to one of the editors, quite recently, “is
that I cannot discover that any of its members really lead the Christ-life.”
This seemed a very serious accusation from a man who is not
only in the front rank of his profession, and valued for his kindly nature,
by his patients, and by society, and well-known as a quiet doer of
many good deeds. The only possible answer to be made was that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Christ-life is undeniably the ideal of every one worthy in any sense of
the name of a Theosophist, and that if it is not lived it is because
there are none strong enough to carry it out. Only a few days later
the same complaint was put in a more graphic form by a celebrated
lady-artist.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You Theosophists don’t do enough good for me,” she said pithily.
And in her case also there is the right to speak, given by the fact that
she leads two lives—one, a butterfly existence in society, and the other
a serious one, which makes little noise, but has much purpose. Those
who regard life as a great vocation, like the two critics of the Theosophical
movement whom we have just quoted, have a right to demand
of such a movement more than mere words. They themselves endeavour
very quietly to lead the “Christ-life,” and they cannot understand
a number of people uniting in the effort towards this life without practical
results being apparent. Another critic of the same character who has
the best possible right to criticise, being a thoroughly practical philanthropist
and charitable to the last degree, has said of the Theosophists
that their much talking and writing seems to resolve itself into mere
intellectual luxury, productive of no direct good to the world.</p>

<p class='c028'>The point of difference between the Theosophists (when we use this
term we mean, not members of the Society, but people who are really
using the organization as a method of learning more of the true wisdom-religion
which exists as a vital and eternal fact behind all such efforts) and
the practical philanthropists, religious or secular, is a very serious one, and
the answer, that probably none of them are strong enough yet to lead
the “Christ-life,” is only a portion of the truth. The situation can be put
very plainly, in so many words. The religious philanthropist holds a
position of his own, which cannot in any way concern or affect the
Theosophist. He does not do good merely for the sake of doing good,
but also as a means towards his own salvation. This is the outcome of
the selfish and personal side of man’s nature, which has so coloured and
affected a grand religion that its devotees are little better than the
idol-worshippers who ask their deity of clay to bring them luck in business,
and the payment of debts. The religious philanthropist who hopes
to gain salvation by good works has simply, to quote a well-worn yet
ever fresh witticism, exchanged worldliness for other-worldliness.</p>

<p class='c028'>The secular philanthropist is really at heart a socialist, and nothing
else; he hopes to make men happy and good by bettering their physical
position. No serious student of human nature can believe in this theory
for a moment. There is no doubt that it is a very agreeable one, because
if it is accepted there is immediate, straightforward work to undertake.
“The poor ye have always with you.” The causation which produced
human nature itself produced poverty, misery, pain, degradation, at the
same time that it produced wealth, and comfort, and joy and glory. Lifelong
philanthropists, who have started on their work with a joyous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>youthful conviction that it is possible to “do good,” have, though never
relaxing the habit of charity, confessed to the present writer that, as a
matter of fact, misery cannot be relieved. It is a vital element in
human nature, and is as necessary to some lives as pleasure is to others.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is a strange thing to observe how practical philanthropists will eventually,
after long and bitter experience, arrive at a conclusion which, to
an occultist, is from the first a working hypothesis. This is, that misery
is not only endurable, but agreeable to many who endure it. A noble
woman, whose life has been given to the rescue of the lowest class of
wretched girls, those who seem to be driven to vice by want, said, only a
few days since, that with many of these outcasts it is not possible to raise
them to any apparently happier lot. And this she distinctly stated
(and she can speak with authority, having spent her life literally among
them, and studied them thoroughly), is not so much from any love of vice,
but from love of that very state which the wealthy classes call misery.
They prefer the savage life of a bare-foot, half-clad creature, with no roof
at night and no food by day, to any comforts which can be offered them.
By comforts, we do not mean the workhouse or the reformatory, but the
comforts of a quiet home; and we can give chapter and verse, so to speak,
to show that this is the case, not merely with the children of outcasts,
who might be supposed to have a savage heredity, but with the children
of gentle, cultivated, and Christian people.</p>

<p class='c028'>Our great towns hide in their slums thousands of beings whose history
would form an inexplicable enigma, a perfectly baffling moral picture,
could they be written out clearly, so as to be intelligible. But they are
only known to the devoted workers among the outcast classes, to whom
they become a sad and terrible puzzle, not to be solved, and therefore,
better not discussed. Those who have no clue to the science of life are
compelled to dismiss such difficulties in this manner, otherwise they
would fall, crushed beneath the thought of them. The social question
as it is called, the great deep waters of misery, the deadly apathy of those
who have power and possessions—these things are hardly to be faced by
a generous soul who has not reached to the great idea of evolution, and
who has not guessed at the marvellous mystery of human development.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Theosophist is placed in a different position from any of these
persons, because he has heard of the vast scope of life with which all
mystic and occult writers and teachers deal, and he has been brought
very near to the great mystery. Indeed, none, though they may have
enrolled themselves as Fellows of the Society, can be called in any
serious sense Theosophists, until they have begun to consciously taste
in their own persons, this same mystery; which is, indeed, a law inexorable,
by which man lifts himself by degrees from the state of a beast to
the glory of a God. The rapidity with which this is done is different
with every living soul; and the wretches who hug the primitive task-master,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span><em>misery</em>, choose to go slowly through a tread-mill course which
may give them innumerable lives of physical sensation—whether pleasant
or painful, well-beloved because tangible to the very lowest senses. The
Theosophist who desires to enter upon occultism takes some of Nature’s
privileges into his own hands by that very wish, and soon discovers that
experiences come to him with double-quick rapidity. His business is
then to recognise that he is under a—to him—new and swifter law of
development, and to snatch at the lessons that come to him.</p>

<p class='c028'>But, in recognising this, he also makes another discovery. He sees
that it takes a very wise man to do good works without danger of doing
incalculable harm. A highly developed adept in life may grasp the
nettle, and by his great intuitive powers, know whom to relieve from
pain and whom to leave in the mire that is their best teacher. The poor
and wretched themselves will tell anyone who is able to win their confidence
what disastrous mistakes are made by those who come from a
different class and endeavour to help them. Kindness and gentle
treatment will sometimes bring out the worst qualities of a man or
woman who has led a fairly presentable life when kept down by pain
and despair. May the Master of Mercy forgive us for saying such words
of any human creatures, all of whom are a part of ourselves, according to
the law of human brotherhood which no disowning of it can destroy. But
the words are true. None of us know the darkness which lurks in the
depths of our own natures until some strange and unfamiliar experience
rouses the whole being into action. So with these others who seem more
miserable than ourselves.</p>

<p class='c028'>As soon as he begins to understand what a friend and teacher pain
can be, the Theosophist stands appalled before the mysterious problem
of human life, and though he may long to do good works, equally dreads
to do them wrongly until he has himself acquired greater power and
knowledge. The ignorant doing of good works may be vitally injurious,
as all but those who are blind in their love of benevolence are compelled
to acknowledge. In this sense the answer made as to lack of
Christ-like lives among Theosophists, that there are probably none
strong enough to live such, is perfectly correct and covers the whole
question. For it is not the spirit of self-sacrifice, or of devotion, or of
desire to help that is lacking, but the strength to acquire knowledge and
power and intuition, so that the deeds done shall really be worthy of the
“Buddha-Christ” spirit. Therefore it is that Theosophists cannot pose as
a body of philanthropists, though secretly they may adventure on the path
of good works. They profess to be a body of learners merely, pledged to
help each other and all the rest of humanity, so far as in them lies, to a
better understanding of the mystery of life, and to a better knowledge of
the peace which lies beyond it.</p>

<p class='c028'>But as it is an inexorable law, that the ground must be tilled if the
harvest is to be reaped, so Theosophists are obliged to work in the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>unceasingly, and very often in doing this to make serious mistakes, as do
all workers who are not embodied Redeemers. Their efforts may not
come under the title of good works, and they may be condemned as a
school of idle talkers, yet they are an outcome and fruition of this
particular moment of time, when the ideas which they hold are greeted
by the crowd with interest; and therefore their work is good, as the
lotus-flower is good when it opens in the mid-day sun.</p>

<p class='c028'>None know more keenly and definitely than they that good works
are necessary; only these cannot be rightly accomplished without knowledge.
Schemes for Universal Brotherhood, and the redemption of
mankind, might be given out plentifully by the great adepts of life, and
would be mere dead-letter utterances while individuals remain ignorant,
and unable to grasp the great meaning of their teachers. To Theosophists
we say, let us carry out the rules given us for our society before
we ask for any further schemes or laws. To the public and our critics we
say, try to understand the value of good works before you demand them
of others, or enter upon them rashly yourselves. Yet it is an absolute
fact that without good works the spirit of brotherhood would die in the
world; and this can never be. Therefore is the double activity of
learning and doing most necessary; we have to do good, and we have to
do it <em>rightly</em>, with knowledge.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Before the voice can speak in the presence of the Masters.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>Speech is the power of communication; the moment of entrance
into active life is marked by its attainment.</p>

<p class='c028'>And now, before I go any further, let me explain a little the
way in which the rules written down in “Light on the Path” are
arranged. The first seven of those which are numbered are sub-divisions
of the two first unnumbered rules, those with which I have dealt in the
two preceding papers. The numbered rules were simply an effort of
mine to make the unnumbered ones more intelligible. “Eight” to
“fifteen” of these numbered rules belong to this unnumbered rule which
is now my text.</p>

<p class='c028'>As I have said, these rules are written for all disciples, but for none
else; they are not of interest to any other persons. Therefore I trust no one
else will trouble to read these papers any further. The first two rules,
which include the whole of that part of the effort which necessitates the
use of the surgeon’s knife, I will enlarge upon further if I am asked to
do so. But the disciple is expected to deal with the snake, his lower self,
unaided; to suppress his human passions and emotions by the force of
his own will. He can only demand assistance of a master when this is
accomplished, or at all events, partially so. Otherwise the gates and
windows of his soul are blurred, and blinded, and darkened, and no
knowledge can come to him. I am not, in these papers, purposing to
tell a man how to deal with his own soul; I am simply giving, to the
disciple, knowledge. That I am not writing, even now, so that all who
run may read, is owing to the fact that super-nature prevents this by its
own immutable laws.</p>

<p class='c028'>The four rules which I have written down for those in the West who
wish to study them, are as I have said, written in the ante-chamber of
every living Brotherhood; I may add more, in the ante-chamber of every
living or dead Brotherhood, or Order yet to be formed. When I speak
of a Brotherhood or an Order, I do not mean an arbitrary constitution
made by scholiasts and intellectualists; I mean an actual fact in supernature,
a stage of development towards the absolute God or Good.
During this development the disciple encounters harmony, pure
knowledge, pure truth, in different degrees, and, as he enters these
degrees, he finds himself becoming part of what might be roughly
described as a layer of human consciousness. He encounters his equals,
men of his own self-less character, and with them his association becomes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>permanent and indissoluble, because founded on a vital likeness of nature.
To them he becomes pledged by such vows as need no utterance or
framework in ordinary words. This is one aspect of what I mean by a
Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c028'>If the first rules are conquered the disciple finds himself standing at
the threshold. Then if his will is sufficiently resolute his power of speech
comes; a two-fold power. For, as he advances now, he finds himself
entering into a state of blossoming, where every bud that opens throws
out its several rays or petals. If he is to exercise his new gift, he must
use it in its two-fold character. He finds in himself the power to
speak in the presence of the masters; in other words, he has the right
to demand contact with the divinest element of that state of consciousness
into which he has entered. But he finds himself compelled, by the
nature of his position, to act in two ways at the same time. He cannot
send his voice up to the heights where sit the gods till he has penetrated
to the deep places where their light shines not at all. He has come
within the grip of an iron law. If he demands to become a neophyte, he
at once becomes a servant. Yet his service is sublime, if only from the
character of those who share it. For the masters are also servants;
they serve and claim their reward afterwards. Part of their service is to
let their knowledge touch him; his first act of service is to give some of
that knowledge to those who are not yet fit to stand where he stands.
This is no arbitrary decision, made by any master or teacher or any
such person, however divine. It is a law of that life which the disciple
has entered upon.</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore was it written in the inner doorway of the lodges of the old
Egyptian Brotherhood, “The labourer is worthy of his hire.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ask and ye shall have,” sounds like something too easy and simple
to be credible. But the disciple cannot “ask” in the mystic sense in
which the word is used in this scripture until he has attained the power
of helping others.</p>

<p class='c028'>Why is this? Has the statement too dogmatic a sound?</p>

<p class='c028'>Is it too dogmatic to say that a man must have foothold before he
can spring? The position is the same. If help is given, if work is
done, then there is an actual claim—not what we call a personal claim
of payment, but the claim of co-nature. The divine give, they demand
that you also shall give before you can be of their kin.</p>

<p class='c028'>This law is discovered as soon as the disciple endeavours to speak.
For speech is a gift which comes only to the disciple of power and
knowledge. The spiritualist enters the psychic-astral world, but he
does not find there any certain speech, unless he at once claims it and
continues to do so. If he is interested in “phenomena,” or the mere
circumstance and accident of astral life, then he enters no direct ray of
thought or purpose, he merely exists and amuses himself in the astral
life as he has existed and amused himself in the physical life. Certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>there are one or two simple lessons which the psychic-astral can teach
him, just as there are simple lessons which material and intellectual
life teach him. And these lessons have to be learned; the man who
proposes to enter upon the life of the disciple without having learned
the early and simple lessons must always suffer from his ignorance.
They are vital, and have to be studied in a vital manner; experienced
through and through, over and over again, so that each part of the
nature has been penetrated by them.</p>

<p class='c028'>To return. In claiming the power of speech, as it is called, the
Neophyte cries out to the Great One who stands foremost in the ray of
knowledge on which he has entered, to give him guidance. When he
does this, his voice is hurled back by the power he has approached, and
echoes down to the deep recesses of human ignorance. In some confused
and blurred manner the news that there is knowledge and a
<a id='corr172.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beneficient'>beneficent</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_172.15'><ins class='correction' title='beneficient'>beneficent</ins></a></span> power which teaches is carried to as many men as will listen
to it. No disciple can cross the threshold without communicating this
news, and placing it on record in some fashion or other.</p>

<p class='c028'>He stands horror-struck at the imperfect and unprepared manner in
which he has done this; and then comes the desire to do it well, and
with the desire thus to help others comes the power. For it is a pure
desire, this which comes upon him; he can gain no credit, no glory, no
personal reward by fulfilling it. And therefore he obtains the power to
fulfil it.</p>

<p class='c028'>The history of the whole past, so far as we can trace it, shows very
plainly that there is neither credit, glory, or reward to be gained by this
first task which is given to the Neophyte. Mystics have always been
sneered at, and seers disbelieved; those who have had the added power of
intellect have left for posterity their written record, which to most men
appears unmeaning and visionary, even when the authors have the
advantage of speaking from a far-off past. The disciple who undertakes
the task, secretly hoping for fame or success, to appear as a teacher and
apostle before the world, fails even before his task is attempted, and his
hidden hypocrisy poisons his own soul, and the souls of those he
touches. He is secretly worshipping himself, and this idolatrous practice
must bring its own reward.</p>

<p class='c028'>The disciple who has the power of entrance, and is strong enough to
pass each barrier, will, when the divine message comes to his spirit,
forget himself utterly in the new consciousness which falls on him. If this
lofty contact can really rouse him, he becomes as one of the divine in his
desire to give rather than to take, in his wish to help rather than be
helped, in his resolution to feed the hungry rather than take manna
from Heaven himself. His nature is transformed, and the selfishness
which prompts men’s actions in ordinary life suddenly deserts him.</p>

and very suggestive. It is a warning indeed. The answer must

<p class='c028'>“Take heed that <em>no man</em> lead you astray. For many shall come in my name saying,

<p class='c028'>Two things become evident <em>to all</em> in the above passages, now that their
false rendering is corrected in the revision text: (<i>a</i>) “the coming of
Christ,” means <em>the presence of</em> <span class='sc'>Christos</span> in a regenerated world, and not
at all the actual coming in body of “Christ” Jesus; (<i>b</i>) this Christ is to
be sought neither in the wilderness nor “in the inner chambers,” nor in the
sanctuary of any temple or church built by man; for Christ—the true
esoteric <span class='sc'>Saviour</span>—<em>is no man</em>, but the <span class='sc'>Divine Principle</span> in every human
being. He who strives to resurrect the Spirit <em>crucified in him by his own
terrestrial passions</em>, and buried deep in the “sepulchre” of his sinful flesh;
he who has the strength to roll back <em>the stone of matter</em> from the door of
his own <em>inner</em> sanctuary, he <em>has the risen Christ in him</em>.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The “Son of Man”
is no child of the bond-woman—<em>flesh</em>, but verily of the free-woman—<em>Spirit</em>,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the child of man’s own deeds, and the fruit of his own spiritual
labour.</p>

<p class='c028'>On the other hand, at no time since the Christian era, have the precursor
signs described in <cite>Matthew</cite> applied so graphically and forcibly to
any epoch as they do to our own times. When has nation arisen against
nation more than at this time? When have “famines”—another name
for destitute pauperism, and the famished multitudes of the proletariat—been
more cruel, earthquakes more frequent, or covered such an area
simultaneously, as for the last few years? Millenarians and Adventists
of robust faith, may go on saying that “the coming of (the carnalised)
Christ” is near at hand, and prepare themselves for “the end of the
world.” Theosophists—at any rate, some of them—who understand the
hidden meaning of the universally-expected Avatars, Messiahs, Sosioshes
and Christs—know that it is no “end of the world,” but “the consummation
of the age,” <i>i.e.</i>, the close of a cycle, which is now fast approaching.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
If our readers have forgotten the concluding passages of the article, “The
Signs of the Times,” in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> for October last, let them read them
over, and they will plainly see the meaning of this particular cycle.</p>

<p class='c028'>Many and many a time the warning about the “false Christs” and
prophets who shall lead people astray has been interpreted by charitable
Christians, the worshippers of the dead-letter of their scripture,
as applying to mystics generally, and Theosophists most especially. The
recent work by Mr. Pember, “Earth’s Earliest Ages,” is a proof of it.
Nevertheless, it seems very evident that the words in Matthew’s Gospel
and others can hardly apply to Theosophists. For these were never
found saying that Christ is “Here” or “There,” in wilderness or city,
and least of all in the “inner chamber” behind the altar of any modern
church. Whether Heathen or Christian by birth, they refuse to
materialise and thus degrade that which is the purest and grandest ideal—the
symbol of symbols—namely, the immortal Divine Spirit in man,
whether it be called Horus, Krishna, Buddha, or Christ. None of them
has ever yet said: “I am the Christ”; for those born in the West feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>themselves, so far, only <em>Chréstians</em>,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> however much they may strive to
become <em>Christians</em> in Spirit. It is to those, who in their great conceit and
pride refuse to win the right of such appellation by first leading the life
of <em>Chrestos</em>;<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> to those who haughtily proclaim themselves <em>Christians</em>
(the glorified, the anointed) by sole virtue of baptism when but a few
days old—that the above-quoted words of Jesus apply most forcibly.
Can the prophetic insight of him who uttered this remarkable warning
be doubted by any one who sees the numerous “false prophets” and
pseudo-apostles (<em>of Christ</em>), now roaming over the world? These have
split the one divine Truth into fragments, and broken, in the camp of the
Protestants alone, the rock of the Eternal Verity into three hundred and
fifty odd pieces, which now represent the bulk of their Dissenting sects.
Accepting the number in round figures as 350, and admitting, for argument’s
sake, that, at least, one of these may have the approximate truth, still
349 <em>must be necessarily false</em>.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Each of these claims to have Christ exclusively
in its “inner chamber,” and denies him to all others, while, in truth,
the great majority of their respective followers daily put Christ to death on
the cruciform tree of matter—the “tree of infamy” of the old Romans—indeed!</p>

<p class='c028'>The worship of the dead-letter in the Bible is but one more form of
<em>idolatry</em>, nothing better. A fundamental dogma of faith cannot exist
under a double-faced Janus form. “Justification” <em>by Christ</em> cannot
be achieved at one’s choice and fancy, <em>either</em> by “faith” or by “works”
and James, therefore (ii., 25), contradicting Paul (Heb. xi., 31), and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice
versa</i></span>,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a> one of them must be wrong. Hence, the Bible is <em>not</em> the “Word
of God” but contains at best the words of fallible men and <em>imperfect</em>
teachers. Yet read <em>esoterically</em>, it does contain, if not the <em>whole</em> truth,
still, “<em>nothing but the truth</em>,” under whatever allegorical garb. Only:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quot homines tot sententiæ</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The “Christ principle,” the awakened and glorified Spirit of Truth,
being universal and eternal, the true <em>Christos</em> cannot be monopolized by
any one person, even though that person has chosen to arrogate to himself
the title of the “Vicar of Christ,” or of the “Head” of that or
another State-religion. The spirits of “Chrest” and “Christ” cannot be
confined to any creed or sect, only because that sect chooses to exalt
itself above the heads of all other religions or sects. The name has
been used in a manner so intolerant and dogmatic, especially in our
day, that Christianity is now the religion of arrogance <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>, a
stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a
convenient screen for hypocrisy. The noble epithet of old, the one that
made Justin Martyr say that “<em>from the mere name</em>, which is imputed to us
as a crime, <em>we are the most excellent</em>,”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> is now degraded. The missionary
prides himself with the so-called <em>conversion</em> of a heathen, who makes of
Christianity ever a <em>profession</em>, but rarely a religion, a source of income
from the missionary fund, and a pretext, since the blood of Jesus has
washed them all by anticipation, for every petty crime, from drunkenness
and lying up to theft. That same missionary, however, would not
hesitate to publicly condemn the greatest saint to eternal perdition and
hell fires if that holy man has only neglected to pass through the fruitless
and meaningless form of baptism by water with accompaniment of <em>lip</em>
prayers and vain ritualism.</p>

<p class='c028'>We say “lip prayer” and “vain ritualism” knowingly. Few Christians
among the laymen are aware even of the true meaning of the word
<em>Christ</em>; and those of the clergy who happen to know it (for they are
brought up in the idea that to study such subjects is <em>sinful</em>) keep the
information secret from their parishioners. They demand blind, implicit
faith, and <em>forbid inquiry as the one unpardonable sin</em>, though nothing of
that which leads to the knowledge of the truth can be aught else than
holy. For what is “Divine Wisdom,” or <em>Gnosis</em>, but the essential reality
behind the evanescent appearances of objects in nature—the very soul
of the manifested <span class='sc'>Logos</span>? Why should men who strive to accomplish
union with the one eternal and absolute Deity shudder at the idea of
prying into its mysteries—however awful? Why, above all, should they
use names and words the very meaning of which is a sealed mystery to
them—a mere sound? Is it because an unscrupulous, power-seeking
Establishment called a Church has cried “wolf” at every such attempt,
and, denouncing it as “blasphemous,” has ever tried to kill the spirit of
inquiry? But Theosophy, the “divine Wisdom,” has never heeded that
cry, and has the courage of its opinions. The world of sceptics and
fanatics may call it, one—an empty “<em>ism</em>”—the other “Satanism”: they
can never crush it. Theosophists have been called Atheists, haters of
Christianity, the enemies of God and the gods. They are none of these.
Therefore, they have agreed this day to publish a clear statement of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>ideas, and a profession of their faith—with regard to monotheism and
Christianity, at any rate—and to place it before the impartial reader to
judge them and their detractors on the merits of their respective faiths.
No truth-loving mind would object to such honest and sincere dealing,
nor will it be dazzled by any amount of new light thrown upon the
subject, howsoever much startled otherwise. On the contrary, such
minds will thank <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, perhaps, while those of whom it was said
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>qui vult decipi decipiatur</em></span>”—let them be deceived by all means!</p>

<p class='c028'>The editors of this magazine propose to give a series of essays upon
the hidden meaning or esotericism of the “New Testament.” No more
than any other scripture of the great world-religions can the Bible be
excluded from that class of allegorical and symbolical writings which
have been, from the pre-historic ages, the receptacle of the secret teachings
of the Mysteries of Initiation, under a more or less veiled form.
The primitive writers of the <em>Logia</em> (now the Gospels) knew certainly <em>the</em>
truth, and the <em>whole</em> truth; but their successors had, as certainly, only
dogma and form, which lead to hierarchical power at heart, rather than the
spirit of the so-called Christ’s teachings. Hence the gradual perversion.
As Higgins truly said, in the Christologia of St. Paul and Justin Martyr,
we have the esoteric religion of the Vatican, a refined Gnosticism for the
cardinals, a more gross one for the people. It is the latter, only still
more materialized and disfigured, which has reached us in our age.</p>

<p class='c028'>The idea of writing this series was suggested to us by a certain letter
published in our October issue, under the heading of “Are the Teachings
ascribed to Jesus contradictory?” Nevertheless, this is no attempt to
contradict or weaken, in any one instance, that which is said by Mr.
Gerald Massey in his criticism. The contradictions pointed out by the
learned lecturer and author are too patent to be explained away by any
“Preacher” or Bible champion; for what he has said—only in more
terse and vigorous language—is what was said of the descendant of
Joseph Pandira (or Panthera) in “Isis Unveiled” (vol. ii., p. 201), from
the Talmudic <em>Sepher Toldos Jeshu</em>. His belief with regard to the
spurious character of Bible and New Testament, <em>as now edited</em>, is
therefore, also the belief of the present writer. In view of the recent
revision of the Bible, and its many thousands of mistakes, mistranslations,
and interpolations (some confessed to, and others withheld), it
would ill become an opponent to take any one to task for refusing to
believe in the authorised texts.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the editors would object to one short sentence in the criticism
under notice. Mr. Gerald Massey writes:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is the use of taking your ‘Bible oath’ that the thing is true, if
the book you are sworn upon is a magazine of falsehoods already exploded,
or just going off?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Surely it is not a symbologist of Mr. G. Massey’s powers and learning
who would call the “Book of the Dead,” or the Vedas, or any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>ancient Scripture, “a magazine of falsehoods.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Why not regard in the
same light as all the others, the Old, and, <em>in a still greater measure</em>, the
<em>New</em> Testament?</p>

<p class='c028'>All of these are “magazines of falsehoods,” if accepted in the exoteric
dead-letter interpretations of their ancient, and especially their modern,
theological glossarists. Each of these records has served in its turn
as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy
of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made
of their gods bloodthirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all
have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth. But
while cunningly-devised dogmas and intentional misinterpretations by
scholiasts are beyond any doubt, “falsehoods already exploded,” the
texts themselves are mines of universal truths. But for the world
of the profane and sinners, at any rate—they were and still are like the
mysterious characters traced by “the fingers of a man’s hand” on the
wall of the Palace of Belshazzar: <em>they need a Daniel to read and understand
them</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nevertheless, <span class='sc'>Truth</span> has not allowed herself to remain without
witnesses. There are, besides great Initiates into scriptural symbology,
a number of quiet students of the mysteries of archaic esotericism, of
scholars proficient in Hebrew and other dead tongues, who have devoted
their lives to unriddle the speeches of the Sphinx of the world-religions.
And these students, though none of them has yet mastered all the
“seven keys” that open the great problem, have discovered enough to
be able to say: There <em>was</em> a universal mystery-language, in which all
the World Scriptures were written, from <cite>Vedas</cite> to “Revelation,” from
the “Book of the Dead” to the <cite>Acts</cite>. One of the keys, at any rate—the
numerical and geometrical key<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a> to the Mystery Speech is now
rescued; an ancient language, truly, which up to this time remained
hidden, but the evidences of which abundantly exist, as may be proven
by undeniable mathematical demonstrations. If, indeed, the Bible is
forced on the acceptance of the world in its dead-letter meaning, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>face of the modern discoveries by Orientalists and the efforts of
independent students and kabalists, it is easy to prophesy that even the
present new generations of Europe and America will repudiate it, as all
the materialists and logicians have done. For, the more one studies
ancient religious texts, the more one finds that the ground-work of the
New Testament is the same as the ground-work of the Vedas, of the
Egyptian theogony, and the Mazdean allegories. The atonements
by blood—blood-covenants and blood-transferences from gods to men,
and by men, as sacrifices to the gods—are the first key-note struck
in every cosmogony and theogony; soul, life and blood were
synonymous words in every language, pre-eminently with the Jews; and
that blood-giving was life-giving. <a id='badquotes3'></a>“Many a legend among (geographically)
alien nations ascribes soul and consciousness in newly-created
mankind to the blood of the god-creators. Berosus records a Chaldean
legend ascribing the creation of a new race of mankind to the admixture
of dust with the blood that flowed from the severed head of the god
Belus. “On this account it is that men are rational and partake of
divine knowledge,” explains Berosus.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> And Lenormant has shown
(<cite>Beginnings of History</cite>, p. 52, note) that “the Orphics ... said
that the <em>immaterial part of man, his soul</em> (his life) sprang from the blood
of Dionysius Zagreus, whom ... Titans tore to pieces.” Blood
“revivifies the dead”—<i>i.e.</i>, interpreted metaphysically, it gives <em>conscious</em>
life and a soul to the man of matter or clay—such as the modern
materialist is now. The mystic meaning of the injunction, “Verily I
say unto you, except <em>ye eat the flesh</em> of the Son of man and <em>drink his
blood</em>, ye have not life in yourselves,” &amp;c., can never be understood or
appreciated at its true <em>occult</em> value, except by those who hold some of the
<em>seven keys</em>, and yet care little for St Peter.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c013'><sup>[46]</sup></a> These words, whether said
by Jesus of Nazareth, or Jeshua Ben-Panthera, are the words of an
<span class='sc'>Initiate</span>. They have to be interpreted with the help of <em>three</em> keys—one
opening the <em>psychic</em> door, the second that of physiology, and the
third that which unlocks the mystery of terrestrial being, by unveiling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the inseparable blending of theogony with anthropology. It is for
revealing a few of these truths, with the <em>sole view of saving intellectual
mankind from the insanities of materialism and pessimism</em>, that mystics
have often been denounced as the servants of Antichrist, even by those
Christians who are most worthy, sincerely pious and respectable men.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first key that one has to use to unravel the dark secrets involved
in the mystic name of Christ, is the key which unlocked the door to the
ancient mysteries of the primitive Aryans, Sabeans and Egyptians. The
Gnosis supplanted by the Christian scheme was universal. It was the
echo of the primordial wisdom-religion which had once been the
heirloom of the whole of mankind; and, therefore, one may truly say
that, in its purely metaphysical aspect, the Spirit of Christ (the divine
<em>logos</em>) was present in humanity from the beginning of it. The author
of the Clementine Homilies is right; the mystery of Christos—now
supposed to have been taught by Jesus of Nazareth—“was identical”
with that which <em>from the first</em> had been communicated “<em>to those who were
worthy</em>,” as quoted in another lecture.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> We may learn from the Gospel
<em>according</em> to Luke, that the “worthy” were those who had been
initiated into the mysteries of the Gnosis, and who were “accounted
worthy” to attain that “resurrection from the dead” <em>in this life</em> ...
“those who knew that they could die no more, being equal to the angels
as sons of God and sons of the Resurrection.” In other words, they were
the great adepts <em>of whatever religion</em>; and the words apply to all those
who, without being Initiates, strive and succeed, through personal efforts to
<em>live the life</em> and to attain the naturally ensuing spiritual illumination in
blending their personality—the (“Son”) with (the “Father,”) their individual
divine Spirit, <em>the God within</em> them. This “resurrection” can never be
monopolized by the Christians, but is the spiritual birth-right of every
human being endowed with soul and spirit, whatever his religion may be.
Such individual is a <em>Christ-man</em>. On the other hand, those who choose
to ignore the Christ (principle) within themselves, must die <em>unregenerate
heathens</em>—baptism, sacraments, lip-prayers, and belief in dogmas notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c028'>In order to follow this explanation, the reader must bear in mind the
real archaic meaning of the paronomasia involved in the two terms
<em>Chréstos</em> and <em>Christos</em>. The former means certainly more than merely
“a good,” an “excellent man,” while the latter was never applied to any
one living man, but to every Initiate at the moment of <em>his second birth
and resurrection</em>.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> He who finds Christos within himself and recognises
the latter as his only “way,” becomes a follower and an <em>Apostle of
Christ</em>, though he may have never been baptised, nor even have met a
“Christian,” still less call himself one.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>I am unable to say where or when the events related in the following

the personal circumstances of the narrator. All I know is that she

<p class='c028'>“I was concerned in a very prominent way in a political struggle for
liberty and the people’s rights. My part in this struggle was, indeed,
the leading one, but my uncle had been drawn into it at my instance, and
was implicated in a secondary manner only. The government sought
our arrest, and, for a time, we evaded all attempts to take us, but at last
we were surprised and driven under escort in a private carriage to a
military station, where we were to be detained for examination. With
us was arrested a man popularly known as ‘Fou,’ a poor weakling
whom I much pitied. When we arrived at the station which was our
destination, ‘Fou’ gave some trouble to the officials. I think he
fainted, but at all events his conveyance from the carriage to the <em>caserne</em>
needed the conjoined efforts of our escort, and some commotion was
caused by his appearance among the crowd assembled to see us.
Clearly the crowd was sympathetic with us and hostile to the military.
I particularly noticed one woman who pressed forward as ‘Fou’ was
being carried into the station, and who loudly called on all present to
note his feeble condition and the barbarity of arresting a witless creature
such as he. At that moment my uncle laid his hand on my arm and
whispered: ‘Now is our time; the guards are all occupied with <a id='corr185.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“Fou;”'>‘Fou;’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_185.35'><ins class='correction' title='“Fou;”'>‘Fou;’</ins></a></span>
we are left alone for a minute; let us jump out of the carriage and run!’
As he said this he opened the carriage door on the side opposite to the
<em>caserne</em> and alighted in the street. I instantly followed, and the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>favouring us, we pressed through them and fled at the top of our speed
down the road. As we ran I espied a pathway winding up a hill-side
away from the town, and cried: ‘Let us go up there; let us get away
from the streets!’ My uncle answered: ‘No, no; they would see us
there immediately at that height, the path is too conspicuous. Our best
safety is to lose ourselves in the town. We may throw them off our
track by winding in and out of the streets.’ Just then a little child,
playing in the road, got in our way, and nearly threw us down as we
ran. We had to pause a moment to recover ourselves. ‘That child
may have cost us our lives,’ whispered my uncle breathlessly. A second
afterwards we reached the bottom of the street which branched off right
and left. I hesitated a moment; then we both turned to the right. As
we did so—in the twinkling of an eye—we found ourselves in the midst
of a group of soldiers coming round the corner. I ran straight into the
arms of one of them, who the same instant knew me and seized me by
throat and waist with a grip of iron. This was a horrible moment! The
iron grasp was sudden and solid as the grip of a vice; the man’s arm
held my waist like a bar of steel. ‘I arrest you!’ he cried, and the
soldiers immediately closed round us. At once I realised the hopelessness
of the situation; the utter futility of resistance. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘<i>Vous n’avez pas
besoin de me tenir ainsi</i>,’</span> I said to the officer; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘<i>j’irai tranquillement</i>.’</span> He
loosened his hold and we were then marched off to another military
station, in a different part of the town from that whence we had
escaped. The man who had arrested me was a sergeant or some
officer in petty command. He took me alone with him into the guard-room,
and placed before me on a wooden table some papers which he
told me to fill in and sign. Then he sat down opposite to me
and I looked through the papers. They were forms, with blanks left for
descriptions specifying the name, occupation, age, address and so forth of
arrested persons. I signed these, and pushing them across the table to
the man, asked him what was to be done with us. ‘You will be shot,’
he replied, quickly and decisively. ‘Both of us?’ I asked. ‘Both,’ he
replied. ‘But,’ said I, ‘my companion has done nothing to deserve
death. He was drawn into this struggle entirely by me. Consider, too,
his advanced age. His hair is white; he stoops, and, had it not been
for the difficulty with which he moves his limbs, both of us would
probably be at this moment in a place of safety. What can you gain
by shooting an old man such as he?’ The officer was silent. He
neither favoured nor discouraged me by his manner. While I sat
awaiting his reply, I glanced at the hand with which I had just signed
the papers, and a sudden idea flashed into my mind. ‘At least,’ I said,
‘grant me one request. If my uncle <em>must</em> die, <em>let me die first</em>.’ Now I
made this request for the following reason. In my right hand, the line
of life broke abruptly halfway in its length; indicating a sudden and
violent death. But the point at which it broke was terminated by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>perfectly marked <em>square</em>, extraordinarily clear-cut and distinct. Such a
square, occurring at the end of a broken line means <em>rescue</em>, <em>salvation</em>.
I had long been aware of this strange figuration in my hand, and had
often wondered what it presaged. But now, as once more I looked at
it, it came upon me with sudden conviction that in some way I was
destined to be delivered from death at the last moment, and I thought
that if this be so it would be horrible should my uncle have been killed
first. If <em>I</em> were to be saved I should certainly save him also, for my
pardon would involve the pardon of both, or my rescue the rescue of
both. Therefore it was important to provide for his safety until after
my fate was decided. The officer seemed to take this last request into
more serious consideration than the first. He said shortly: ‘I may be
able to manage that for you,’ and then at once rose and took up the
papers I had signed. ‘When are we to be shot?’ I asked him.
‘To-morrow morning,’ he replied, as promptly as before. Then he went
out, turning the key of the guard-room upon me.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The dawn of the next day broke darkly. It was a terribly stormy
day; great black lurid thunderclouds lay piled along the horizon, and
came up slowly and awfully against the wind. I looked upon them with
terror; they seemed so near the earth, and so like living, watching
things. They hung out of the sky, extending long ghostly arms downwards,
and their gloom and density seemed supernatural. The soldiers
took us out, our hands bound behind us, into a quadrangle at the back
of their barracks. The scene is sharply impressed on my mind. A
palisade of two sides of a square, made of wooden planks, ran round
the quadrangle. Behind this palisade, and pressed up close against it
was a mob of men and women—the people of the town—come to see
the execution. But their faces were sympathetic; an unmistakable look
of mingled grief and rage, not unmixed with desperation—for they were
a down-trodden folk—shone in the hundreds of eyes turned towards us.
I was the only woman among the condemned. My uncle was there, and
poor ‘Fou,’ looking bewildered, and one or two other prisoners. On the
third and fourth sides of the quadrangle was a high wall, and in a
certain place was a niche partly enclosing the trunk of a tree, cut off at
the top. An iron ring was driven into the trunk midway, evidently for
the purpose of securing condemned persons for execution. I guessed
it would be used for that now. In the centre of the square piece of
ground stood a file of soldiers, armed with carbines, and an officer with
a drawn sabre. The palisade was guarded by a row of soldiers somewhat
sparsely distributed, certainly not more than a dozen in all. A
Catholic priest in black cassock walked beside me, and as we were
conducted into the enclosure, he turned to me and offered religious
consolation. I declined his ministrations, but asked him anxiously if he
knew which of us was to die first. ‘<em>You</em>,’ he replied; ‘the officer in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>charge of you said you wished it, and he has been able to accede to your
request.’ Even then I felt a singular joy at hearing this, though I had
no longer any expectation of release. Death was, I thought, far too
near at hand for that. Just then a soldier approached us, and
led me, bare-headed, to the tree trunk, where he placed me
with my back against it, and made fast my hands behind me
with a rope to the iron ring. No bandage was put over my
eyes. I stood thus, facing the file of soldiers in the middle of
the quadrangle, and noticed that the officer with the drawn sabre placed
himself at the extremity of the line, composed of six men. In that
supreme moment I also noticed that their uniform was bright with steel
accoutrements. Their helmets were of steel and their carbines, as they
raised them and pointed them at me, ready cocked, glittered in a fitful
gleam of sunlight with the same burnished metal. There was an
instant’s stillness and hush while the men took aim; then I saw the
officer raise his bared sabre as the signal to fire. It flashed in the air;
then, with a suddenness impossible to convey, the whole quadrangle
blazed with an awful light—a light so vivid, so intense, so blinding, so
indescribable that everything was blotted out and devoured by it. It
crossed my brain with instantaneous conviction that this amazing glare
was the physical effect of being shot, and that the bullets had pierced
my brain or heart, and caused this frightful sense of all-pervading flame.
Vaguely I remembered having read or having been told that such was the
result produced on the nervous system of a victim to death from fire-arms.
‘It is over,’ I said, ‘that was the bullets.’ But presently there
forced itself on my dazed senses a sound—a confusion of sounds—darkness
succeeding the white flash—then steadying itself into gloomy
daylight; a tumult; a heap of stricken, tumbled men lying stone-still
before me; a fearful horror upon every living face; and then ... it all
burst on me with distinct conviction. The storm which had been gathering
all the morning had culminated in its blackest and most electric point
immediately over-head. The file of soldiers appointed to shoot me stood
exactly under it. Sparkling with bright steel on head and breast and
carbines, they stood shoulder to shoulder, a complete lightning conductor,
and at the end of the chain they formed, their officer, at the
critical moment, raised his shining, naked blade towards the sky.
Instantaneously heaven opened, and the lightning fell, attracted by the
burnished steel. From blade to carbine, from helmet to breastplate it
ran, smiting every man dead as he stood. They fell like a row of nine-pins,
blackened in face and hand in an instant—in the twinkling of an
eye. <em>Dead.</em> The electric flame licked the life out of seven men in that
second; not one moved a muscle or a finger again. Then followed a
wild scene. The crowd, stupefied for a minute by the thunderbolt and
the horror of the devastation it had wrought, recovered sense, and with
a mighty shout hurled itself against the palisade, burst it, leapt over it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and swarmed into the quadrangle, easily overpowering the unnerved
guards. I was surrounded, eager hands unbound mine, arms were
thrown about me; the people roared, and wept, and triumphed, and fell
about me on their knees praising Heaven. I think rain fell, my face
was wet with drops, and my hair—but I knew no more, for I swooned
and lay unconscious in the arms of the crowd. My rescue had indeed
come, and from the very Heavens!”</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE INVISIBLE WORLD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>In many of the tasks of life the first step costs the great effort,
and the investigation of truth in the higher regions of Nature
justifies the familiar maxim. The first step for the modern inquirer
is that which carries his consciousness across the threshold of matter
into the invisible world. Never mind for the moment whether occult
progress be attempted by a direct onslaught on the defences of the invisible
world, or by purely internal combats with the desires of the lower self.
The unseen must first become a reality for anyone who seriously desires
to enter into relations with it, whether he sets his will to work to vanquish
his own frailties, or the forces of Nature on the astral plane. An internal
struggle with material desire undertaken for a spiritual purpose, just as
much as the other kind of contest, is a recognition of the superior realm;
and it is not a struggle of the kind we are contemplating at all, if it is
merely undertaken for a worldly purpose, as thrifty habits may be cultivated,
for instance, at the bidding of the grossest material selfishness.
But though a recognition of the invisible world must in this way have
been forced, at an early stage of his inquiry, on the mind of everyone
who becomes an earnest explorer of Nature’s higher laws, its invisibility
is a terrible barrier in the way of the progress that would otherwise be
made by the throngs of intelligent materialists who people civilised countries
at this epoch of our history. From the point of view of conventional
thinkers—of those alike who sacrifice their Sunday mornings
to provide for the contingency that there may be something in religion
after all, and of those who are frankly incredulous of any Nature lying
beyond the reach of instrumental research—a tremendous revolution in
all their views of life is accomplished if they are somehow brought
face to face with the reality of super-material phenomena, if they ever
discover the invisible world and come to know it, or any part of it, as an
unequivocal fact.</p>

<p class='c028'>Long experienced explorers of the unseen often forget how profoundly
clouded the whole region seems from the shore of materialistic thought.
Indeed, from the shore of other systems where habits of metaphysical
speculation would lead men to repudiate the charge of materialism,
the unseen appears to be equally impenetrable to all human faculties.
It is as though we lived beside an ocean always shrouded from view
by a belt of mist. A few persons are in the constant habit of
pushing out beyond in boats, but these, when they come back,
are told, “Nonsense! there is no ocean; you have been dreaming!”
For the vast majority, the mist is an infinite void. Only
by a minority have the few who have passed through it, been even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>encountered. Will anyone who knows his generation pretend to say that
even among ordinary religious people the next world is a certain fact in
Nature, like the next street? How many are there who do more than
rest on the hypothesis that there may be somewhere a heaven to “go to”
when the dreadful moment comes at which mortal man must perforce
bid adieu to the warm precincts of the cheerful day. “God forbid!” a
bishop is said to have piously remarked when warned, during danger at
sea, that he would be in Heaven that night. The next world of commonplace
orthodoxy is but too often regarded as a desperate resource for
ruined men, whose fortune of life has been wrung from them to the last
drop. For those who are bankrupt of breath, “let us trust” (as a frequent
phrase expresses the idea) that some compensation may be provided by
Providence hereafter, though it does all remain so hopelessly obscure.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah, if you could only show me that there really is a life beyond this—a
perpetuation of this real individual Me after I am what my friends will
call dead—you would be giving me a blessing that no words could
over-estimate.” That is a passionate cry from many hearts to those who
talk of other lives for the soul—of spiritual rewards, or the fruit of Karma
in future states of existence.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is a cry which few people indeed, even among those who have been
in contact with the invisible world, are in a position to satisfy. Most of
us are obliged to reply: “This satisfaction can only be acquired by a
resolute effort; it is impossible for us to bring you proof of what we
know, to save you trouble. If you would know whether Africa exists, we
cannot bring you Africa to prove it; we can only give you directions how
to get there if you are willing to undertake the journey.” “But why,” we
might ask, “cannot you believe the testimony of those who have had
proof of the sort you require.” The answer always is in effect: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<i>C’est le
premier pas qui coute</i></span>. It would be worth worlds to know, but to believe
without personal knowledge—that would be an act of faith. I might as
easily believe at once in the Roman Catholic Church.”</p>

<p class='c028'>There is a great difference, really, between the surrender of that
reason claimed by ecclesiastical tyranny and the faith required to enable
a seeker after truth to gain personal cognisance of the invisible world.
The priest and the occultist both claim faith from the neophyte; but the
first bids him develop this by strangling his reason, the second by
satisfying it. Sensible faith is that which recognises the logic of facts
appealing to human intelligence. It is stupid to believe that which you
have no reason for believing; it is no less stupid to disbelieve that which
there is reason to believe. The majority of modern men and women,
indeed—fed exclusively on the husks of knowledge—are too profoundly
ignorant of the records accumulated by those who have penetrated the
unseen to be called stupid for undervaluing them. But on one or the
other horn of the dilemma they must take their place. They are unconscious
of the existence of the records left, or of the work done by students of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>occultism in its various phases; or they must be held responsible for
defects of understanding. Does anyone say: “What are the records you
refer to?” The answer would be analogous to one that might be
given to a person brought up in American backwoods, on modern
practicalities exclusively, and who in mature life should hear someone
refer to classical literature as important. “What book do you want me
to read?” he might ask. What would an accomplished University
devotee of Greek poetry <em>think</em> in reply, even if he tried to disguise his
answer in polite terms?</p>

<p class='c028'>Any fairly considerable acquaintance with the literature of occult
research—including in that broad designation records of any supermaterial
phenomena—will put any man in a position in which he must
either believe in the existence of the invisible world, or discover that he
is an irrational being, whose “convictions” are merely acts of submission
to the decrees of the multitude. And then, for most of those who
perceive that they must believe, or who find that they cannot
continue to disbelieve, some personal contact with some phases of
the invisible world will probably follow in the sequence of events;
because, once <em>believing</em>—once saturated with a complete conviction that
there are other planes of Nature—these will present themselves to the
mind as so interesting, that it becomes worth while to take trouble in
order to get the gratification of beholding their phenomena in some way
or other; and then success will sooner or later be attained. While
people merely think “there <em>may be</em> an invisible world, let us try if we
can find it out,” they are easily baffled by failure. They draw one or two
covers “blank” and retire from the effort declaring “there is nothing to
be discovered; it is all a delusion.” The man who has read and
assimilated what he has read is, as we have said above, saturated with a
conviction on the subject. His state of mind remains unaffected by
personal failure; and still impelled by the fascination of the idea, he
will try again and again till he succeeds. When anyone says, “I <em>wish</em>
I could see something out of the common way, but I never have any
luck in such things,” the answer is: “Then you certainly do not wish
<em>much</em>.” Probably such people do not wish enough to take the trouble
merely to study. What they wish is that conclusive phenomena
demonstrating the existence of the invisible world should always be on
view at some London theatre, where inquirers might go without liability
to disappointment, when other engagements permitted.</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet, though it is so easy to blame and ridicule that attitude of
mind, no one who has the influence of the higher occultism in his heart,
and at the same time a capacity for sympathising with the best attributes
of modern culture, can be otherwise than indefatigably anxious to waken
up the present generation more fully to an appreciation of the sublime
knowledge accessible to those who get across the outer barriers and
come to realise the existence of the world beyond, once for all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Occultists will often fail to understand the situation aright. There are
some who would do nothing but draw from their own knowledge of the
invisible world a store of moral maxims, and serve these out to their
brethren, fearing to suggest further inquiries lest danger should be
incurred, for, of course, people are put in danger the higher they climb,
falls being then more disastrous. But maxims to have any value must
be in circuit with knowledge. “Be good!” is a sound maxim. “Be
good children!” is often an efficient exhortation, but it will not survive
the period when the persons addressed say “Why?” And all the
educated world is saying “Why?” now in regard to injunctions which
rest upon incredible assertions. Why is Society so tolerant of some misdoing
which the Church has always specially condemned, though it lies
outside the catalogue of offences like robbery and murder, proscribed by
common convenience? Because maxims which merely rest upon religion
have no longer any binding force; in other words, because religion is
the science, or the sum total of the sciences of the invisible world, and
men now claim to have cut and dried maxims overhauled on principles
to which this age of science has accustomed them. It is quite possible
to get this done. The fact that this <em>is</em> a scientific age is a declaration,
in other words, that a time has come for putting a scientific complexion
on religious thought; in other words again, for beginning to lead the
public, in flocks, where hitherto rare pioneers only have penetrated in
secret—across the threshold unto the limitless realms of the invisible
world. By flocks we need not be supposed to mean crude masses of
humanity selected on no system, but large numbers compared to the
rare explorers of former times, considerable groups of the most
intelligent and advanced minds of the age. A man of the present day,
who has obtained the beautiful culture of modern civilisation, who may
be an accomplished classic, a finely-trained man of science, a poet, an
artist, and yet a person so ignorant or stupid (as to certain facets of his
mind) as not to know anything about the invisible world, is a creature
who provokes in the more enlightened observer a feeling analogous to
that with which one might look at a lady of fashion, beautiful in the
face, but whose winning draperies you know to hide ugly deformities or
repulsive disease. Or treating the subject more abstractedly, this lovely
culture of modern civilisation is like the soulless statue—the Galatea
without life. Surely it is time that the gods informed the marble with
the breath of the spirit; and have they not shown themselves ready to
do this if the sculptor does but appeal to them?</p>

<p class='c028'>The man who penetrates, or gets into relations of some sort or other
with the invisible world, will not necessarily be illuminated at once with
a flood of exhilarating knowledge. The new realm may open out
before the explorer in many different ways; and there is much going
astray amidst its innumerable mazes for new comers, as a rule. But to
discuss these perils in detail would be to attempt an essay on all branches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of occultism. For the present we are arguing merely that to make no
journeys there at all is to give up progress, to move no longer with the
onward stream of evolution, to fall out of the line of march.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is deplorable that men of intelligence, in the present day, should
neglect to pick up the threads which might guide them to some knowledge
of the invisible world, for two reasons, or rather, the reasons why
this is deplorable may be divided into two great classes, those which
have reference to knowledge, as such, and those which have reference
to the spiritual interests of mankind. To people who appreciate
spiritual interests, nothing else is relatively worth a thought; but
for men of modern civilisation at large knowledge is worth everything
for its own sake; it is the end they are pursuing, and this being so,
it is astounding that they neglect the most subtle, fascinating and
intricate phenomena of all nature, those which have to do with supermaterial
planes of existence and natural force. And from that point of
view, any passage across the threshold of the invisible world will do as
well as any other. The tables that move without hands, the pencils
that write without fingers, are surely linked with mysteries of Nature
not yet understood, and, therefore, worth examination. Investigations
concerning them bring one face to face with the forces of the invisible
world.</p>

<p class='c028'>Are we told that science cannot grasp these phenomena to investigate
them? The statement is not true. They cannot be grasped at any
time by anybody, but no more can the depths of stellar space be
fathomed by whoever chooses whenever it suits his leisure. Great
telescopes are scarce; nights perfectly fitted for observation must be
waited for with patience. But when they come, the men who have got
the telescopes take observations and make reports, and their records are
studied by other astronomers, and used as the foundation of theories,
as the raw material of current knowledge. If similar methods were
adopted with even the crudest spiritualistic, not to speak of scientific,
research in occult mystery, the world at large would not be blundering
about as it is, with absurd denials of facts known to thousands. Clairvoyance
again, by flights of perception through the invisible world,
bridges gulfs that are materially impassable. But what does modern
culture know of it? As a scientific fact, it is enormously more certain
than the existence, for example, of the satellites of Mars; but who
disputes the latter fact? They have been seen, those satellites, if they
are not seen easily or often, and therefore their existence has been
established. But five newspapers out of six in the present day—barometers
of prevailing belief—would profess to disbelieve in clairvoyance
if the subject had to be mentioned; to <em>disbelieve</em> in that which is
an elementary truth having to do with the most easily accessible region
of supermaterial knowledge!</p>

<p class='c028'>To gain touch with this is <em>not</em> to be put at once in possession of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>certainty concerning the survival after death of the real “Me” in each
case, which is the great point to be established for most European
doubters, but it is the first step. Students of the laws which govern existence
in the higher realms of Nature can gain no hearing from those to
whom that great point remains unsatisfied. Once the higher realm is
felt to be a reality, the possibility of gaining a knowledge of the laws
which prevail there presents itself to the mind with an altogether new
significance. And finally, closer attention shows that this knowledge
certainly has been gained; that the path leading to spiritual wisdom is
defined; that with some of the powers which reign in the invisible world
we may enter into more or less definite relations beforehand here; that of
all practical pursuits which men of clear heads and resolute purpose can set
themselves to, during the space of incarnate earthly life, immeasurably
the most practical, in so far as it has to do with objects which dwarf all others
in their importance, are those which have to do with the culture and development
of that Higher Self within them which has its natural home in
the invisible world, and is but a passing guest in the midst of material occupations.
To use and apply the knowledge of supermaterial laws which
occult studies disclose is a life’s task, but of that for the moment we need
not speak. It is with the heedless and frivolous generation at large that
we are concerned in this appeal—with those who waste great gifts of intelligence
and splendid energies and courage and indomitable industry
on transitory pursuits, on money-making (in excess), on discovery and
research that merely subserve passing material wants, on the struggle for
flattering distinctions which cast a meteoric gleam on the brief journey to
personal oblivion, on the “solid realities” of the visible world, which, like the
ice drops of a hailstorm, are as hard as bullets one minute and dissolved in
new forms the next. It is all for want of taking the first step that
they are squandering their lives. Their immediate predecessors <em>knew</em>
no more than they perhaps of the hidden mysteries, but they were less
critical of the distorted shape in which pious tradition told them of the
future and of the powers above. The heirs of modern thought have
grown in knowledge of molecules and of the transmutation of energy
but as they look back upon the beliefs which contented their forefathers,
they perceive that their fuller science of the physical plane has entirely
shut out the wide, vague prospect that used to gleam on the earlier
horizon.</p>

<p class='c028'>Rational human creatures cannot afford to leave that prospect in a permanent
eclipse. The neglect of all facts concerned with the durabilities
of existence; the concentration of effort and interest on the hastily dissolving
view of its physically manifested phases, is the crying folly of the
period. To spring at once into complete conscious spiritual relationship
with the higher planes of Nature is not an easy achievement. The great
Realities lie within a domain which makes no direct appeal to the five
senses of the earthly body, and the only way of approaching their comprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>is to press on through the darkness, beyond which other men
before us declare that they have reached illuminated altitudes.</p>

<p class='c028'>But meanwhile, the torpor of the educated world at large in regard to
the promptings which ought now to stir its activity in this direction is
little less than idiotic. Idiotic relatively, that is to say, to spiritual culture.
There are men of illustrious fame in the various provinces of intellectual
culture, who are behaving relatively to their own higher potentialities, as
the luckless victim of a shallow skull may behave towards the teachings
of science and art. But there is always one thing to be remembered
about them; they are curable. Their cure can be undertaken with sure
certainty of success at any moment, but for each sufferer from that inner
cataract which shuts out from his consciousness the prospect of the
invisible world, there is only one surgeon who can successfully perform
the necessary operation—the man himself. What we can do who have
accomplished the feat for ourselves, is to encourage others—not to <em>go</em>, but
to come and do likewise.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class='c035'>Adventure is said to be sweet to the young; if it was so to
Hilary, he must soon have found abundant pleasure in the
possession of enough sweets. For the next few days scarcely an
hour passed without an event large enough in his eyes to be an adventure.</p>

<p class='c028'>He was ready at the hour Fleta had named; and had provided against
all probable contingencies by taking with him the smallest possible
amount of luggage. For aught he knew they might have to climb mountains
in the course of this journey. And moreover he knew Fleta’s unprincess-like
distaste for superfluities; he would not have been surprised
to see her start in her riding habit and take no luggage at all. The
difficulty he dreaded was his mother’s surprise at this scant provision of
his. But good luck—or was it something else?—took her away. She
was summoned to visit a sick friend at a little distance out of the city,
and said good-bye to Hilary before her departure. So Hilary made his
preparations without being troubled by criticism.</p>

<p class='c028'>At noon a lad presented himself at the door of the Estanol’s house,
with a note which he said he was to give into Hilary’s own hand. Hilary
immediately went to him and took it, as he guessed it was from Fleta.
A single line!—and no signature!—</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am waiting for you outside the north gate.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary took his valise in his hand, afraid to hire a carriage lest it
should not please her that he brought any eyes to note their meeting.
He walked out of the city by the quietest side streets he could select,
hoping not to meet any of his friends. He met no one he knew, and
with a sigh of relief passed out through the gate and walked on to the
broad country road beyond it. Drawn up under some trees was a
handsome travelling carriage, with four horses and postilions. Hilary
was surprised. He had not expected so much luxury. When he
reached the carriage he was even more surprised. Fleta was hardly
dressed as for a journey; she wore a much richer robe than usual, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>her head and shoulders were covered with beautiful black lace. She
leaned back in a corner of the roomy carriage, with a voluptuous dreamy
expression on her face which was new to Hilary. Opposite her sat
Father Amyot. Hilary could not but regard the priest with amazement.
Was the town to lose its favourite confessor? How then could all the
gossips in it be prevented from hearing of the Princess Fleta’s journey?
But Hilary resolved not to harass himself with conjecture. He entered
the carriage and Fleta motioned to him to seat himself at her side.</p>

<p class='c028'>At her side! Yes, that was his place. And Father Amyot, the father
confessor, beloved and almost worshipped by the people, in whose breast
reposed the secrets and the sorrows of the city; Father Amyot, who was
the model of piety to all who knew him, sat opposite in the carriage.
Did he watch the lovers? Seemingly not. His eyes were lowered and
his gaze was apparently fixed on his clasped hands. He sat there like
a statue. Once or twice when Hilary glanced at his face, he fancied he
must be there unwillingly. Was it so? Was he Fleta’s tool and
servant held by her domineering temper to do her bidding? Surely
not. Father Amyot was too well known as a man of power for the idea
to be credible. Hilary checked himself for the hundredth time in these
hopeless speculations and determined to enjoy the moment he was in
possession of and not trouble about the next one till it came; nor
yet endeavour to read others’ hearts. And so this young philosopher
went open eyed, as he believed, to his destruction.</p>

<p class='c028'>The carriage rolled away at a great speed; it was drawn by four
beautiful Russian horses, and the postilions were Fleta’s own, and accustomed
to her likings. She was a most daring and intrepid rider and
nothing pleased her in the way of motion except great speed. She was
a lover of animals and her horses were the finest kept in the city. It
was strange to Hilary to try and realise her singular independence of
position, as to-day he felt impelled to. For himself he was still to a
great extent in leading strings; he had made no position for himself,
nor even planned any career; he was dependent on his mother’s fortune,
and consequently, to a certain extent, could act only according to her
approval. He was still so young that all this seemed natural enough.
But Fleta was younger than himself, though it was difficult always to
remember it, so dominant was her temper. A glance at her fresh face
still so soft in its outlines as to have something childish about it
when her expression permitted; at her figure, so slender in spite of
its stateliness, recalled the fact that the Princess was indeed only a
girl. Did the man who was about to marry her suppose that his young
Queen was a creature unformed, fresh from the schoolroom, altogether
malleable to his hand?</p>

<p class='c028'>During the whole of the afternoon they drove on with scarcely a
pause, and with very little conversation to pass the time. Yet for
Hilary it flew with swift wings. The mere sensation of his novel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>position was enough for him as yet. To be beside Fleta and to watch
her mysterious face for so long together satisfied for the moment his
longing soul. Fleta herself seemed buried in profound thought. She
sat silent, her eyes on the country they passed through, but her mind, as
far as Hilary could judge, wandering in some remote region. As for
Father Amyot, his regard remained fixed upon a small crucifix which he
held hidden within his clasped hands, and now and then his lips moved
in prayer, while, on that austere face, no expression seemed to have room
but that of adoration or contemplation of the divine.</p>

<p class='c028'>At sundown they stopped at a very small way-side inn. Hilary
could not believe they were going to stay here, for it looked little more
than a place where men drink and horses are fed. Yet so it was. The
carriage was driven round to the side of the small house, the horses
taken out of it, and Fleta led the way in at a side door, followed by her
two companions.</p>

<p class='c028'>Within they found a motherly, plain and kindly woman, who evidently
knew Fleta well; Hilary learned afterwards that this landlady had been a
kitchen maid in the royal household. And now he saw strange things
indeed. For this inn was in reality nothing but a drinking shop for
the drivers who passed along the road. It had no parlour, nor any
accommodation for travellers of a better sort. And Fleta knew this, as
was evident at once. She drew a hard chair forward, <a id='corr195.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='clos'>close</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_195.22'><ins class='correction' title='clos'>close</ins></a></span> to the great
fire which flamed up the wide open chimney, and sat down seemingly
quite at her ease.</p>

<p class='c028'>“We must have some supper,” she said to the landlady. “Get us
what you can. Can you find room for these gentlemen to-night?”</p>

<p class='c028'>The landlady came near to Fleta and spoke in a low voice; the
Princess laughed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“There are no bedrooms in this house, it seems,” she said, aloud, “in fact,
it is not an hotel. Shall we drive on or shall we sit here through the night?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The horses are tired,” said Father Amyot, speaking for the first time
since they had left the city.</p>

<p class='c028'>“True,” said Fleta, absently—for already she appeared to be
thinking of something else. “I suppose, then, we must stay here.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary had never passed, nor ever contemplated passing, a night in
such rough fashion. He was fond of comfort, or rather of luxury. But
what could he do when his Princess, the greatest lady in the land, set
him the example. Any protest would have appeared effeminate, and
his pride held him silent. Still, when after a very indifferent supper,
they all returned to the hard wooden chairs beside the fire, Hilary for
the moment very sincerely wished himself at home in his own comfortable
rooms. As he wished this, suddenly he became aware that Fleta’s
dark eyes had turned upon him, and he would not look up, for he
believed she had read his thought. He wished he could have hidden it
from her, for he had no mind to be held as more effeminate than herself.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>There was a sort of second kitchen even rougher and more cheerless
than the one in which they sat; and there the postilions and other
men, the ordinary customers of the house, were crowded together,
drinking and talking and singing. Their presence was horrid to Hilary,
who was conscious of refined susceptibilities, but Fleta seemed quite
indifferent to the noise they made and the odour of their coarse
tobacco; or rather it might be that she was unaware of anything
outside her own thoughts. She sat, her chin on her hand, looking into
the fire; and so graceful and perfect was her attitude that she had the
air of being a masterpiece of art placed amid the commonest surroundings.
She looked more lovely than ever from the contrast, but yet
the incongruity was painful to Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>The silence in the room in which they sat became the more marked
from contrast with the increasing noise in the crowded room without.
At last, however, the hour came for the house to be closed and the
landlady politely showed her customers the door; all except those who
were travellers on the road. These, including the postilions, gathered
into the chimney corner and became quiet, at last falling sound asleep.
To Hilary it seemed now that he was living through a painful dream,
and he longed for the awakening—willing to awake, even if that meant
that he would be at home and away from Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>At last sleep came to him, and his head drooped forward; he sat there,
upright in the wooden chair, fast asleep. When he awoke it was with a
sense of pain in every limb, from the posture which he had maintained;
and he could scarcely refrain from crying out when he attempted to move.
But he instantly remembered that if the others were sleeping he must
not wake them. Then he quickly looked round. Father Amyot sat
near, looking just as he had looked since they entered the house; he
might have been a statue. Fleta’s chair was empty.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary roused himself, sat up and stared at her empty place; then
looked all round the kitchen. An idea occurred to him; possibly the
landlady had found some resting place for the young Princess. A sense
of oppression came over him; the kitchen seemed stifling. He rose with
difficulty and stretched himself, then found his way out into the air. It
was a glorious morning; the sun had just risen, the world seemed like a
beautiful woman seen in her sleep. How sharp the sweet fresh air was!
Hilary drew a deep breath of it. The country in which this lonely little
inn stood was exceedingly lovely, and at this moment it wore its most
fascinating appearance. A sense of great delight came upon Hilary;
the uneasiness of the past night was at an end, and he was glad now and
full of youth and strength. He turned and walked away from the house,
soon leaving the road and plunging into the dewy grass. There was a
stream in the valley, and here he determined to bathe. He soon reached
it, and in another moment had hastily undressed, and was plunged in the
ice-cold water. An intoxicating sense of vigour came over him as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>experienced the keen contact. Never had he felt so full of life as now!
It was not possible to remain long in the water, it was so intensely cold;
he sprang out again and stood for a moment on the bank in the brilliant
morning sunshine, looking like a magnificent figure carved by the god of
the day, his flesh gleaming in the light. Slowly he began at last to put
on his dress, feeling as if in some way this meant a partial return and
submission to civilization. Something of the savage which lay deep
hidden in him had been roused and touched. A fire burned that hitherto
he had never felt, and which made him long for pure freedom and uncriticised
life. And this was Hilary Estanol! It seemed incredible that
a draught of fresh morning air, a plunge into ice-cold water beneath the
open sky, should have been enough to unloose the savage in him, which
was held fast beneath his conventional and languid self, as it is in all of
us, and all those whom we meet in ordinary life. He moved hastily,
striding on as though he were hurrying to some end, but it was merely a
new pleasure in motion. There was a grove of old yew trees near the
stream; a grove which with the superstitious was held to be sacred. That
it should be revered was no wonder, so stately were the ancient trees, so
deep the shadow they cast. Hilary went towards this grove, attracted
by its splendid appearance; as he approached its margin a dim sense of
familiarity came over him. Never had he left the city by this road, yet
it seemed to him that he had entered the grove of yews by the early
morning light already many a time. We are all accustomed to meet
with this curious sensation; Hilary laughed at it and put it away. What
if he had visited this spot in a dream? Now it was broad daylight, and
he felt himself young and a giant. He plunged into the deep shadow,
pleased by the contrast it made to the brilliant light without.</p>

<p class='c028'>Suddenly his heart leaped within him and his brain reeled. For there
before him, stood Fleta; and the brilliant Princess looked like a spirit of
the night, so pale and grave and proud was her face and so much a part
did she seem of the deep shadow of the wood.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Is it you?” she said with a smile, a smile of mystery and deep unfathomable
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes it is!” he answered, and felt, as he spoke, that he said something
in those words which he did not himself understand. They stood side by
side for a moment in silence; and then Hilary remembered himself to be
alone with this woman, alone with her in the midst of the world. They
were separated by the hour from other men and women, for the world
still lay asleep; they were separated by the deep shadow of the wood
from all moving life that answered to the sun. They were alone—and
overwhelmed by this sudden sense of solitude Hilary spoke out
his soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Princess,” he said, “I am ready to be your blind servant, your dumb
slave, speaking and seeing only when you tell me. You know well why
I am willing to be the tool in your hands. It is because I love you. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>you must pay a price for your tool if you would have it! I cannot only
worship at your feet. Fleta, you must give yourself to me, absolutely,
utterly. Marry that man to whom you are betrothed if you desire to be
a queen, but to me you must give your love, yourself. Ah! Fleta, you
cannot refuse me!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta stood still a long moment, her eyes upon his face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she said, “I cannot refuse you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>And to Hilary, for an instant of horror, it seemed to him that in her
eyes was a glance of ineffable scorn. Yet there was love in the smile on
her lips and in the touch of her hand as she laid it in his.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The bond is made,” she said, “all that you can take of me is yours.
And I will pay you for your love with my love. Only do not forget that
you and I are different—that we are after all, two persons—that we cannot
love in exactly the same way. Do not forget this!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary knew not what to answer. As she spoke the last words he recognised
his princess, he saw the queen before him. What did she mean?
Well, he was so unhappy that his love had gone from him to a lady of
royal birth. It could not be undone, this folly. He must be content to
take that part which a subject may take in the life of a queen, even though
he be her lover. The thought brought a pang, a swift stab to his heart
and a sigh burst from his lips. Fleta put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do not be sad so soon,” she said, “let us wait for trouble. Come, let
us go out into the sunshine.”</p>

<p class='c028'>They went out, hand in hand; they wandered down beside the stream
and looked into the gleaming waters.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p class='c035'>That day the journey began early, and was very protracted. Twice
during it they halted at little inns to rest the horses and to obtain what
food they could. By the evening they had entered upon the most
deserted region of the great forest which was one of the prides of the
country. The King’s hunting seat, where he now was, stood in a part of
this forest, but in quite another region, a long distance from this wild
place where Hilary and his companions now were. Hilary had never
been within the forest, as few from the city ever penetrated it except as
part of the King’s retinue, and then they only saw such tracts of it as
were preserved and in order. Of this wilder region practically little
was known, and the spirit of adventure within Hilary made him rejoice
to find that their journey led them through this unpopulated district.
His curiosity as to their destination was not now very acute, for the
experiences of the passing moments were all sufficient. It is true that
he was conscious of the great gulf fixed between himself and Fleta.
He knew her to be his superior in every respect. He knew not only
that he must always be separated from her by their difference in station
but that he was more vitally separated from her by their difference in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>thought—and that even now. But he was made happy by a look of
love that plunged deep from her eyes into his own now and again, and
he was thrilled to the heart when her hand touched his with a light and
delicate pressure that he alone could understand. Ah! that secret
understanding which separates lovers from all the rest of the world.
How sweet it is! How strange it is, too, for they are overpowered by a
mutual sense of sympathy which appears to be a supreme intelligence,
giving each the power to look into the other’s heart. Dear moments
are they when this is realised, when all life outside the sacred circle in
which the two dwell is obscure and dim, while that within is rich, and
strong, and sweet. Hilary lived supremely content only in the consciousness
of being near this woman whom he loved; for now that he
had actually asked her love, and been granted it, nothing else existed
for him save that sweet fact. He was indifferent to the hardships, and,
indeed, probable dangers, of the journey they were upon, which might
have made a more intrepid spirit uneasy; for now he was content to
suffer, or even to die, if all conditions were shared with Fleta. All her
life could not be shared with him, but all his could be shared with her.
When a man reaches this point, and is content to face such a state of
things between himself and the woman he loves, he may be reckoned
as being in love indeed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Quite late at night it was when this day’s journey ended, and the
splendid horses were really tired out. But a certain point evidently had
to be reached, and the postilions pushed on. Fleta at last seemed to
grow a little anxious, and several times rose in the carriage to look on
ahead; once or twice she inquired of the postilions if they were certain
of their way. They answered yes; though how that could be was to
Hilary a mystery, for they had been for a long while travelling over mere
grass tracts, of which there were many, to his eyes undistinguishable one
from the other. But the postilions either had landmarks which he could
not detect, or else knew their way very well. At last they stopped; and
in the dim light Hilary saw that there was a gate at the side of the track,
a gate wide enough to drive through, but of the very simplest construction.
It might have defended merely a spot where young trees were planted,
or some kind of preserving done; and it was set in a fence of the same
character, almost entirely hidden by thick growth of wild shrubs. The
Princess Fleta produced from her dress a whistle on which she sounded
a clear ringing note, and then everybody sat still and waited. It seemed
to Hilary that it was quite a long while that they waited; perhaps it was
not really long, but the night was so still, the silence so profound, the
feeling of expectancy so strong. He was, for the first time since they
started, really very curious as to what would happen next. What did
happen at last was this. There was a sound of laughter and footsteps,
and presently two figures appeared at the gate; one that of a tall man,
the other that of a young, slight girl. The gate was unlocked and thrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>wide open, and a moment later the young girl was in the carriage, embracing
Fleta with the greatest enthusiasm and delight. Hilary hardly
knew how everything happened, but presently the whole party was
standing together inside the gate, the carriage had driven in and was
out of sight. Then the tall man shut and locked the gate, after which
he turned back, and walked on ahead with the young girl at his side,
while Hilary followed with Fleta. The moon had risen now, and Hilary
could see her beautiful face plainly, wearing on it an unusually gay and
happy expression; her lips seemed to smile at her own thoughts. The
sweet gladness in her face made Hilary’s heart spring with joy. It
could not be rejoining her friends that made her so glad, for they had
gone on and left her alone with him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta—my princess—no, my Fleta,” he said, “are you happy to be
with me? I think you are!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, I am happy to be with you—but I am not Fleta.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Not Fleta!” echoed Hilary, in utter incredulity.</p>

<p class='c028'>He stopped, and catching his companion’s hand, looked into her
face. She glanced up, and her eyes were full of shy coquetry and ready
gaiety.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I might be her twin sister, might I not, if I am not Fleta herself?
Ah! no, Fleta’s fate is to live in a court—mine to live in a forest Live!—no,
it is not life!”</p>

<p class='c028'>What was it in that voice that made his heart grow hot with passion?
Fiercely he exclaimed to himself that it <em>was</em>, it <em>must</em>, be Fleta’s voice.
No other woman could speak in such tones—no other woman’s words
give him such a sense of maddening joy.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh! yes,” he said, “it is life—when one loves, one lives anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, perhaps, when one loves!” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You told me this morning that you loved me, Fleta!” cried Hilary
in despair.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah! but I am not Fleta,” was the mocking answer. It sounded like
mockery indeed as she spoke. And yet the voice was Fleta’s. There
was no doubt of that. He looked, he listened, he watched. The voice,
the face, the glorious eyes, were Fleta’s. It was Fleta who was beside
him, say she what she might.</p>

<p class='c028'>They had been following the others all this while, and had now
reached a clearing in the wood, where was a garden full of sweet flowers,
as Hilary could tell at once by the rich scents that came to him on the
night air.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am glad we have reached the house,” said his companion, “for I
am very tired and hungry. Are not you? I wonder what we shall
have for supper. You know this is an enchanted place which we call
the palace of surprises. We never know what will happen next. That
is why one can enjoy a holiday here as one can enjoy it no where else.
At home there is a frightful monotony about the eating and drinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Everything is perfect, of course, but it is always the same. Now here
one is fed like a Russian one day, and a Hungarian the next. There is
a perpetual novelty about the menus, and yet they are always good. Is
not that extraordinary. And oh! the wines, great heavens! what a
cellar our sainted father keeps. I can only bless, with all my heart, the
long dead founders of his order, who instituted such a system.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary had regarded his companion with increasing amazement during
this speech. Certainly it was unlike Fleta. Was she acting for his
benefit? But at the words “sainted father” another idea thrust that one
out of his head. What had become of Father Amyot? He had not
seen him leave the carriage, or approach the house.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, your holy companion has gone to his brethren,” said the girl,
with a laugh. “They have a place of their own where they torture
themselves and mortify the flesh. But they entertain us well, and that
is what I care for. We will have a dance to-night. Oh! Hilary, the
music here! It is better than that of any band in the world!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“If you are not, Fleta, how do you know my name?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Simple creature! What a question! Why, Fleta has told me all
about you. Did you never hear that the princess had a foster-sister, and
that none could ever tell which was which, so like were we—and are we!
Did you never hear that Fleta’s mother was blonde, and dull, and plain,
and that Fleta is like none of her own family? Oh, Hilary, you, fresh
from the city, you know nothing!”</p>

<p class='c028'>A sudden remembrance crossed Hilary’s mind.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I <em>have</em> heard,” he said, “that no one could tell where Fleta had
drawn her beauty from. But I believe you draw it from <a id='corr201.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='you'>your</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_201.26'><ins class='correction' title='you'>your</ins></a></span> own
beautiful soul!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah, you still think me Fleta? I have had some happy hours in the
city before now when Fleta has let me play at being a princess. Ah, but
the men all thought the princess in a strange, charming, delightful
humour on these days. And when next they saw her, that humour was
gone, and they were afraid to speak to her. Come in. I am starving!”</p>

<p class='c028'>They had entered a wide, low doorway, and stood now within the
great hall. What a strange hall it was! The floor was covered with the
skins of animals, many of them very handsome skins; and great jars
held flowering plants, the scent from which made the air rich and heavy.
A wood fire burned on the wide hearth, and before it, still in the dress
she had travelled in, stood—Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>Yes, Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>The girl who stood at Hilary’s side laughed and clapped her hands as
he uttered a cry of amazement, even of horror.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This is some of your magic, Fleta!” he exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Princess turned at his words. She was looking singularly grave
and stern; her glance gave Hilary a sense of almost fear.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she answered in a low, quiet voice that had a tone, as Hilary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>fancied, of pain, “it is not magic. It is all very natural. This is Adine,
my little sister; so like me that I do not know her from myself.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She drew Adine to her with a gesture which had a protecting tenderness
in it. This was the Princess who spoke, queen-like in her kindness.
Hilary stood, unable to speak, unable to think, unable to understand.
Before him stood two girls—each Fleta. Only by the difference of
expression could he detect any difference between them. One threw
him back the most coquettish and charming glance, as she went
towards her grave sister. He could feel keenly how vitally different the
two were. Yet they stood side by side, and though Fleta said “my
little sister” there was no outward difference between them. Adine was
as tall, as beautiful—and the same in everything!</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do not be startled,” said Fleta quietly, “you will soon grow used
to the likeness.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Though I doubt,” added Adine, with a wicked glance from her
brilliant eyes, “whether you will ever tell us apart except when we are
not together.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” said Fleta, “let us go and wash the travel stains off. It is
just supper time.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta talked of travel stains, but as Hilary looked at her queenly
beauty, he thought she seemed as fresh as though she had but from this
moment come from the hands of her maid. However, the two went
away arm in arm, Adine turning at the door to have one last glance of
amusement at Hilary’s utterly perplexed face. He was left alone, and
he remained standing where he was, without power of thought or
motion.</p>

<p class='c028'>Presently some one came and touched him on the shoulder; this was
necessary in order to attract his attention. It was the tall man who had
come to the gate to meet them. He was very handsome, and with the
most cheerful and good-natured expression; his blue eyes were full of
laughter.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” he said, “come and see your room. I am master of the
ceremonies here; apply to me for anything you want—even information!
I may, or may not give it, according to the decision of the powers
that be. Call me Mark. I have a much longer name, in fact, half-a-dozen
much longer ones, and a few titles to boot; but they would not
interest you, and in the midst of a forest where nobody has any dignity,
a name of one syllable is by far the best.” While he talked on like
this, apparently indifferent as to whether Hilary listened or no, he led
the way out of the hall and down a wide, carpeted corridor. He opened
the last door in this, and ushered Hilary in.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE SCIENCE OF LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>What is Life? Hundreds of the most philosophical minds,
scores of learned well-skilled physicians, have asked themselves
the question, but to little purpose. The veil thrown over
primordial Kosmos and the mysterious beginnings of life upon it, has
never been withdrawn to the satisfaction of earnest, honest science.
The more the men of official learning try to penetrate through its dark
folds, the more intense becomes that darkness, and the less they see,
for they are like the treasure-hunter, who went across the wide seas to
look for that which lay buried in his own garden.</p>

<p class='c028'>What is then this Science? Is it biology, or the study of life in its
general aspect? No. Is it physiology, or the science of organic function?
Neither; for the former leaves the problem as much the riddle of the
Sphinx as ever; and the latter is the science of death far more than
that of life. Physiology is based upon the study of the different organic
functions and the organs necessary to the manifestations of life, but that
which science calls living matter, is, in sober truth, <em>dead matter</em>. Every
molecule of the living organs contains the germ of death in itself, and
begins dying as soon as born, in order that its successor-molecule should
live only to die in its turn. An organ, a natural part of every living
being, is but the medium for some special function in life, and is a
combination of such molecules. The vital organ, the <em>whole</em>, puts the
mask of life on, and thus conceals the constant decay and death of its
parts. Thus, neither biology nor physiology are the science, nor even
branches of the <em>Science of Life</em>, but only that of the <em>appearances</em> of life.
While true philosophy stands Œdipus-like before the Sphinx of life,
hardly daring to utter the paradox contained in the answer to the riddle
propounded, materialistic science, as arrogant as ever, never doubting
its own wisdom for one moment, biologises itself and many others
into the belief that it has solved the awful problem of existence. In
truth, however, has it even so much as approached its threshold? It is
not, surely, by attempting to deceive itself and the unwary in saying
that life is but the result of molecular complexity, that it can ever hope to
promote the truth. Is vital force, indeed, only a “phantom,” as Du-Bois
Reymond calls it? For his taunt that “life,” as something independent,
is but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>asylum ignorantiæ</i></span> of those who seek refuge in abstractions,
when direct explanation is impossible, applies with far more force and
justice to those materialists who would blind people to the reality of
facts, by substituting bombast and jaw-breaking words in their place.
Have any of the five divisions of the functions of life, so pretentiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>named—Archebiosis, Biocrosis, Biodiæresis, Biocænosis and Bioparodosis<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a>,
ever helped a Huxley or a Hæckel to probe more fully the
mystery of the generations of the humblest ant—let alone of man?
Most certainly not. For life, and everything pertaining to it, belongs to
the lawful domain of the <em>metaphysician</em> and psychologist, and physical
science has no claim upon it. “That which hath been, is that which
shall be; and that which hath been is named already—and it is known
that it is MAN”—is the answer to the riddle of the Sphinx. But
“man” here, does not refer to <em>physical</em> man—not in its esoteric meaning,
at any rate. Scalpels and microscopes may solve the mystery of the
material parts of <em>the shell of man</em>: they can never cut a window into
his soul to open the smallest vista on any of the wider horizons of being.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is those thinkers alone, who, following the Delphic injunction, have
cognized life in their <em>inner</em> selves, those who have studied it thoroughly
in themselves, before attempting to trace and analyze its reflection in
their outer shells, who are the only ones rewarded with some
measure of success. Like the fire-philosophers of the Middle Ages, they
have skipped over the <em>appearances</em> of light and fire in the world of effects,
and centred their whole attention upon the producing arcane agencies.
Thence, tracing these to the one abstract cause, they have attempted to
fathom the <span class='sc'>Mystery</span>, each as far as his intellectual capacities permitted
him. Thus they have ascertained that (1) the <em>seemingly</em> living mechanism
called physical man, is but the fuel, the material, upon which life feeds,
in order to manifest itself; and (2) that thereby the inner man receives
as his wage and reward the possibility of accumulating additional experiences
of the terrestrial illusions called lives.</p>

<p class='c028'>One of such philosophers is now undeniably the great Russian novelist
and reformer, Count Lef N. Tolstoi. How near his views are to the
esoteric and philosophical teachings of higher Theosophy, will be found
on the perusal of a few fragments from a lecture delivered by him at
Moscow before the local Psychological Society.</p>

<p class='c028'>Discussing the problem of life, the Count asks his audience to admit,
for the sake of argument, <em>an impossibility</em>. Says the lecturer:—</p>

<p class='c028'>Let us grant for a moment that all that which modern science longs
to learn of life, it has learnt, and now knows; that the problem has
become as clear as day; that it is clear how organic matter has, by simple
adaptation, come to be originated from inorganic material; that it is as
clear how natural forces may be transformed into feelings, will, thought,
and that finally, all this is known, not only to the city student, but to
every village schoolboy, as well.</p>

<p class='c028'>I am aware, then, that such and such thoughts and feelings originate
from such and such motions. Well, and what then? Can I, or cannot
I, produce and guide such motions, in order to excite within my brain
corresponding thoughts? The question—what are the thoughts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>feelings I ought to generate in myself and others, remains still, not only
unsolved, but even untouched.</p>

<p class='c028'>Yet it is precisely this question which is the <em>one</em> fundamental question
of the central idea of life.</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes4'></a>Science has chosen as its object a few manifestations that accompany
life; and <em>mistaking</em><a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> the part for the whole, called these manifestations
the integral total of life....”</p>

<p class='c028'>The question inseparable from the idea of life is not <em>whence</em> life, but
<em>how one should live</em> that life: and it is only by first starting with this
question that one can hope to approach some solution in the problem of
existence.</p>

<p class='c028'>The answer to the query “How are we to live?” appears so simple to
man that he esteems it hardly worth his while to touch upon it.</p>

<p class='c028'>... One must live the best way one can—that’s all. This seems at
first sight very simple and well known to all, but it is by far neither
as simple nor as well known as one may imagine....</p>

<p class='c028'>The idea of life appears to man in the beginning as a most simple
and self-evident business. First of all, it seems to him that life is in
himself, in his own body. No sooner, however, does one commence his search
after that life, in any one given spot of the said body, than one
meets with difficulties. Life is not in the hair, nor in the nails; neither is
it in the foot nor the arm, which may both be amputated; it is not in the
blood, it is not in the heart, and it is not in the brain. It is everywhere
and it is nowhere. It comes to this: life cannot be found in any of its
dwelling-places. Then man begins to look for life in Time; and that,
too, appears at first a very easy matter.... Yet again, no sooner has he
started on his chase than he perceives that here also the business is more
complicated than he had thought. Now, I have <em>lived</em> fifty-eight years,
so says my baptismal church record. But I know that out of these fifty-eight
years I slept over twenty. How then? have I lived all these years,
or have I not? Deduct the months of my gestation, and those I passed
in the arms of my nurse, and shall we call this life, also? Again, out
of the remaining thirty-eight years, I know that a good half of that time
I slept while moving about; and thus, I could no more say in this case,
whether I lived during that time or not. I may have lived a little, and
vegetated a little. Here again, one finds that in time, as in the body, life is
everywhere, yet nowhere. And now the question naturally arises, whence,
then, that life which I can trace to nowhere? Now—will I learn....
But it so happens that in this direction also, what seemed to me so easy at
first, now seems impossible. I must have been searching for something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>else, not for my life, <a id='corr206.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='assuredly,'>assuredly.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_206.1'><ins class='correction' title='assuredly,'>assuredly.</ins></a></span> Therefore, once we have to go in
search of the whereabouts of life—if search we have to—then it should
be neither in space nor in time, neither as cause nor effect, but as a something
which I cognize within myself as quite independent from Space,
time and causality.</p>

<p class='c028'>That which remains to do now is to study <em>self</em>. But how do I cognize
life in myself?</p>

<p class='c028'>This is how I cognize it. I know, to begin with, that I live; and that
I live wishing for myself everything that is good, wishing this since I can
remember myself, to this day, and from morn till night. All that
lives outside of myself is important in my eyes, but only in so far as it
co-operates with the creation of that which is productive of <em>my</em> welfare.
The Universe is important in my sight only because it can give <em><a id='corr206.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='me,'>me</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_206.13'><ins class='correction' title='me,'>me</ins></a></span></em>,
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c028'>Meanwhile, something else is bound up with this knowledge in me of
my existence. Inseparable from the life I feel, is another cognition
allied to it; namely, that besides myself, I am <a id='corr206.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='surrrounded'>surrounded</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_206.17'><ins class='correction' title='surrrounded'>surrounded</ins></a></span> with a whole
world of living creatures, possessed, as I am myself, of the same instinctive
realization of their exclusive lives; that all these creatures
live for their own objects, which objects are foreign to me; that those
creatures do not know, nor do they care to know, anything of my pretensions
to an exclusive life, and that all these creatures, in order to
achieve success in their objects, are ready to annihilate me at any moment.
But this is not all. While watching the destruction of creatures similar
in all to myself, I also know that for me too, for that precious <span class='fss'>ME</span> in
whom alone life is represented, a very speedy and inevitable destruction
is lying in wait.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is as if there were two “I’s” in man; it is as if they could never
live in peace together; it is as if they were eternally struggling, and ever
trying to expel each other.</p>

<p class='c028'>One “I” says, “I alone am living as one should live, all the rest only
seems to live. Therefore, the whole <i>raison d’être</i> for the universe is in
that <em>I</em> may be made <a id='corr206.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='comfortable.'>comfortable.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_206.31'><ins class='correction' title='comfortable.'>comfortable.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>The other “I” replies, “The universe is not for thee at all, but for its own
aims and purposes, and it cares little to know whether thou art happy or
unhappy.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Life becomes a dreadful thing after this!</p>

<p class='c028'>One “I” says, “I only want the gratification of all my wants and desires,
and that is why I need the universe.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The other “I” replies, “All animal life lives only for the gratification of
its wants and desires. It is the wants and desires of animals alone that
are gratified at the expense and detriment of other animals; hence the
ceaseless struggle between the animal species. Thou art an animal, and
therefore thou hast to struggle. Yet, however successful in thy struggle,
the rest of the struggling creatures must sooner or later crush thee.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Still worse! life becomes still more dreadful....</p>

<p class='c028'>But the most terrible of all, that which includes in itself the whole of
the foregoing, is that:—</p>

<p class='c028'>One “I” says, “I want to live, to live for ever.”</p>

<p class='c028'>And that the other “I” replies, “Thou shalt surely, perhaps in a few
minutes, die; as also shall die all those thou lovest, for thou and they
are destroying with every motion your lives, and thus approaching ever
nearer suffering, death, all that which thou so hatest, and which thou
fearest above anything else.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is the worst of all....</p>

<p class='c028'>To change this condition is impossible.... One can avoid moving,
sleeping, eating, even breathing, but one cannot escape from thinking.
One thinks, and that thought, <em>my</em> thought, is poisoning every step in my
life, as a personality.</p>

<p class='c028'>No sooner has man commenced a conscious life than that consciousness
repeats to him incessantly without respite, over and over the same
thing again. “To live such life as you feel and see in your past, the life
lived by animals and many men too, lived in <em>that</em> way, which made
you become what you are now—is no longer possible. Were you to
attempt doing so, you could never escape thereby the struggle with all
the world of creatures which live as you do—for their personal objects;
and then those creatures will inevitably destroy you.”...</p>

<p class='c028'>To change this situation is impossible. There remains but one thing
to do, and that is always done by him who, beginning to live, transfers
his objects in life outside of himself, and aims to reach them.... But,
however far he places them outside his personality, as his mind gets
clearer, none of these objects will satisfy him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Bismarck, having united Germany, and now ruling Europe—if his
reason has only thrown any light upon the results of his activity—must
perceive, as much as his own cook does who prepares a dinner that will
be devoured in an hour’s time, the same unsolved contradiction between
the vanity and foolishness of all he has done, and the eternity and reasonableness
of that which exists for ever. If they only think of it, each will
see as clearly as the other; <em>firstly</em>, that the preservation of the integrity
of Prince Bismarck’s dinner, as well as that of powerful Germany, is
solely due: the preservation of the former—to the police, and the
preservation of the latter—to the army; and that, so long only as both
keep a good watch. Because there are famished people who would
willingly eat the dinner, and nations which would fain be as powerful as
Germany. Secondly, that neither Prince Bismarck’s dinner, nor the
might of the German Empire, coincide with the aims and purposes
of universal life, but that they are in flagrant contradiction with them.
And thirdly, that as he who cooked the dinner, so also the might of
Germany, will both very soon die, and that so shall perish, and as
soon, both the dinner and Germany. That which shall survive alone is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the Universe, which will never give one thought to either dinner or
Germany, least of all to those who have cooked them.</p>

<p class='c028'>As the intellectual condition of man increases, he comes to the idea
that no happiness connected with his personality is an achievement, but
only a necessity. Personality is only that incipient state from which
begins life, and the ultimate limit of life....</p>

<p class='c028'>Where, then, does life begin, and where does it end, I may be asked?
Where ends the night, and where does day commence? Where, on the
shore, ends the domain of the sea, and where does the domain of land
begin?</p>

<p class='c028'>There is day and there is night; there is land and there is sea; there
is life and there is <em>no</em> life.</p>

<p class='c028'>Our life, ever since we became conscious of it, is a pendulum-like
motion between two limits.</p>

<p class='c028'>One limit is, an absolute unconcern for the life of the infinite Universe
an energy directed only toward the gratification of one’s own
personality.</p>

<p class='c028'>The other limit is a complete renunciation of that personality, the
greatest concern with the life of the infinite Universe, in full accord
with it, the transfer of all our desires and good will from one’s self, to
that infinite Universe and all the creatures outside of us.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c013'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>The nearer to the first limit, the less life and bliss, the closer to the
second, the more life and bliss. Therefore, man is ever moving from one
end to the other; <i>i.e.</i> he lives. <span class='sc'>This motion is life itself.</span></p>

<p class='c028'>And when I speak of life, know that the idea of it is indissolubly
connected in my conceptions with that of <em>conscious</em> life. No other life is
known to me except conscious life, nor can it be known to anyone
else.</p>

<p class='c028'>We call life, the life of animals, organic life. But this is no life at all,
only a certain state or condition of life manifesting to us.</p>

<p class='c028'>But what is this consciousness or mind, the exigencies of which
exclude personality and transfer the energy of man outside of him and
into that state which is conceived by us as the blissful state of love?</p>

<p class='c028'>What is conscious mind? Whatsoever we may be defining, we have to
define it with our conscious mind. Therefore, with what shall we define
mind?...</p>

<p class='c028'>If we have to define all with  our mind, it follows that conscious mind
cannot be defined. Yet all of us, we not only know it, but it is the only
thing which is given to us to know undeniably....</p>

<p class='c028'>It is the same law as the law of life, of everything organic, animal or
vegetable, with that one difference that we <em>see</em> the consummation of an
intelligent law in the life of a plant. But the law of conscious mind, to
which we are subjected as the tree, is subjected to its law, we <em>see</em> it not,
but fulfil it....</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>We have settled that life is that which is not our life. It is herein that
lies hidden the root of error. Instead of studying that life of which
we are conscious within ourselves, absolutely and exclusively—since we
can know of nothing else—in order to study it, we observe that which is
devoid of the most important factor and faculty of our life, namely,
intelligent consciousness. By so doing, we act as a man who attempts to
study an object by its shadow or reflection does.</p>

<p class='c028'>If we know that substantial particles are subjected during their
transformations to the activity of the organism; we know it not because
we have observed or studied it, but simply because we possess a certain
familiar organism united to us, namely the organism of our animal,
which is but too well known to us as the material of our life; <i>i.e.</i> that
upon which we are called to work and to rule by subjecting it to the
law of reason.... No sooner has man lost faith in life, no sooner has he
transferred that life into that which is no life, than he becomes wretched,
and sees death.... A man who conceives life such as he finds it in his
consciousness, knows neither misery, nor death: for all the good in life
for him is in the subjection of his animal to the law of reason, to do
which is not only in his power, but takes place unavoidably in him. The
death of particles in the animal being, we know. The death of animals
and of man, as an animal, we know; but we know nought about the
death of conscious mind, nor can we know anything of it, <em>just
because that conscious mind is the very life itself</em>. And <em>Life can never be
Death</em>....</p>

<p class='c028'>The animal lives an existence of bliss, neither seeing nor knowing
death, and dies without cognizing it. Why then should man have
received the gift of seeing and knowing it, and why should death be so
terrible to him that it actually tortures his soul, often forcing him to kill
himself out of sheer fear of death? Why should it be so? Because the
man who sees death is a sick man, one who has broken the law of his
life, and lives no longer a conscious existence. He has become an animal
himself, an animal which also has broken the law of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>The life of man is an aspiration to bliss, and that which he aspires to
is given to him. The light lit in the soul of man is bliss and life, and
that light can never be darkness, as there exists—verily there exists for
man—only this solitary light which burns within his <a id='corr209.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='soul.”'>soul.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_209.36'><ins class='correction' title='soul.”'>soul.</ins></a></span></p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c028'>We have translated this rather lengthy fragment from the Report of
Count Tolstoi’s superb lecture, because it reads like the echo of the
finest teachings of the universal ethics of true theosophy. His definition
of life in its abstract sense, and of the life every earnest theosophist
ought to follow, each according to, and in the measure of, his <em>natural</em>
capacities—is the summary and the Alpha and the Omega of practical
psychic, if not spiritual life. There are sentences in the lecture which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>to the average theosophist will seem too hazy, and perhaps incomplete.
Not one will he find, however, which could be objected to by the
most exacting, practical occultist. It may be called a treatise on the
Alchemy of Soul. For that “solitary” light in man, which burns for
ever, and can never be darkness in its intrinsic nature, though the
“animal” outside us may remains blind to it—is that “Light” upon
which the Neo Platonists of the Alexandrian school, and after them the
Rosecroix and especially the Alchemists, have written volumes, though
to the present day their true meaning is a dark mystery to most
men.</p>

<p class='c028'>True, Count Tolstoi is neither an Alexandrian nor a modern
theosophist; still less is he a Rosecroix or an Alchemist. But that
which the latter have concealed under the peculiar phraseology of the
Fire-philosophers, purposely confusing cosmic transmutations with
Spiritual Alchemy, all that is transferred by the great Russian thinker
from the realm of the metaphysical unto the field of practical life. That
which Schelling would define as a realisation of the identity of subject
and object in the man’s inner Ego, that which unites and blends the
latter with the universal Soul—which is but the identity of subject
and object on a higher plane, or the unknown Deity—all that Count
Tolstoi has blended together without quitting the terrestrial plane. He
is one of those few <em>elect</em> who begin with intuition and end with <em>quasi</em>-omniscience.
It is the transmutations of the baser metals—the <em>animal
mass</em>—into gold and silver, or the philosopher’s stone, the development
and manifestation of man’s higher, <span class='sc'>Self</span> which the Count has achieved.
The <em>alcahest</em> of the inferior Alchemist is the <em>All-geist</em>, the all-pervading
Divine Spirit of the higher Initiate; for Alchemy was, and is, as very
few know to this day, as much a spiritual philosophy as it is a physical
science. He who knows nought of one, will never know much of the
other. Aristotle told it in so many words to his pupil, Alexander: “It
is not a stone,” he said, of the philosopher’s stone. “<em>It is in every man
and in every place</em>, and at all seasons, and is called the <em>end</em> of all
philosophers,” as the <em>Vedanta</em> is <em>the end</em> of all philosophies.</p>

<p class='c028'>To wind up this essay <em>on the Science of Life</em>, a few words may be
said of the eternal riddle propounded to mortals by the Sphinx. To
fail to solve the problem contained in it, was to be doomed to sure
death, as the Sphinx of life devoured the unintuitional, who would live
only in their “animal.” He who lives for Self, and only for <em>Self</em>, will
surely die, as the higher “I” tells the lower “animal” in the Lecture.
The riddle has seven keys to it, and the Count opens the mystery with
one of the highest. For, as the author on “Hermetic Philosophy”
beautifully expressed it: “The real mystery most familiar and, at the
same time, most unfamiliar to every man, <em>into which he must be initiated
or perish as an atheist, is himself</em>. For him is the elixir of life, to quaff
which, before the discovery of the philosopher’s stone, is to drink the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>beverage of death, while it confers on the adept and the <em>epopt</em>, the true
immortality. He may know truth as it really is—<em>Aletheia</em>, the breath
of God, or Life, the conscious mind in man.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is “the Alcahest which dissolves all things,” and Count Tolstoi
has well understood the riddle.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>SIN AGAINST LIFE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>A newspaper paragraph lately declared that a certain American lady
of great wealth, residing in London, had conceived the strange desire
to possess a cloak made of the soft warm down on the breasts of birds of
Paradise. Five hundred breasts, it was said, were required for this purpose, and
two skilful marksmen, the story went on to aver, had been sent to New Guinea
to shoot the poor little victims whose wholesale slaughter must be accomplished
to gratify this savage whim. We rejoice to observe that the whole statement
has been flatly contradicted by the <cite>World</cite>, apparently on the best possible
authority; but, however little the lady concerned may deserve the reproach which
the authors of the calumny endeavoured to evoke against her, the feeling it may
have excited is worth analysis in a world where, if bird of Paradise cloaks are
rare, most women who dress luxuriously adorn themselves in one way or another
at the expense of the feathered kingdom. The principle involved in a bonnet
which is decorated with the plumage of a single bird, slaughtered for its sake,
is the same as that which would be more grotesquely manifest in a garment that
would require the slaughter of five hundred. Too many rich people in this
greedy age forget that the grandest privilege of those who possess the means is
that they have the power of alleviating suffering. Too many, again, forget that
the sympathies of those who rule the animate world should extend beyond the
limits of their own kind; and thus we have the painful spectacle of human
“sport” associated in civilised countries still, with pursuits which should no
longer afford pleasure to men who have emerged from the primitive life of
hunters and fishers. But how is it possible, let us consider, to stoop lowest
from the proud estate of humanity in search of ignoble gratification? It is
bad to kill any sentient creature for the sake of the savage pleasures of the chase.
It is bad, perhaps worse, to cause their destruction for the sake of coldly profiting
by their slaughter, and it is bad to squander money in this hard world of
want and wide-spread privation on costly personal indulgence. But the acme
of all that is reprehensible in these various departments of ill-doing is surely
reached when women—who should, by virtue of their sex, be helping to soften
the ferocities of life—contrive to collect the cream of evil from each of these
varieties, and to sin against a whole catalogue of human duties by cruel
acquiescence in an unworthy fashion.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>BROTHERHOOD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The Theosophical Society has always placed in the forefront of its
programme, as its first and most important object, the formation
of the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood, without distinction of
race, creed, caste or sex. It would doubtless be incorrect to say that
this object of the Society has been entirely overlooked in the West,
but it is to be feared that not a few members of the Society have
accepted it as an amiable formula, to which no objection could be raised,
and have turned their attention almost exclusively to the two remaining
objects. And yet, without some attempt to understand the true meaning
of this Universal Brotherhood, it is idle to expect that any great
services can be rendered to the cause of Theosophy. It may be useful
to see whether any explanation can be given of the reason for the
neglect of this first object, and whether such light may be thrown on its
meaning, as may render the idea a living reality to many who now but
faintly grasp its significance.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the first place it may be said, that in many enlightened Western
minds, there was already a familiarity with the idea thus enunciated.
Christianity has always taught the “theoretical” equality in the sight of
God, of all true believers, and politically the dogma of “equal rights” is
practically beyond the reach of attack. The abolition of slavery, the
extension of representative government, the spread of education, and
perhaps also, in some degree, the influence of the scientific as opposed to
the religious theories of the origin and destiny of man, have all combined
to render this idea by no means difficult of apprehension, at least
intellectually. Further its acceptance in this sense has not necessarily
entailed any different view of the duties and responsibilities of life. In
the East it cannot be said that this is the case. In India, the stringency
of caste regulations causes class distinctions to assume a very definite
form, while religious hatreds, if not more bitter than with us, enter more
directly into the life of the people, and interpose stronger barriers
between man and man than in Europe or America. Hence an Indian
theosophist must, before he can accept the first object, even in its outward
form, modify to some extent his intellectual conception of the
relations in which he stands to the rest of mankind, and he will in his
life give practical proof of the change. In his case the acceptance of the
outward form can only follow on the appreciation of the inner meaning;
that which results is that his theosophy is firmly founded on the
principle of the Universal Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c028'>On the other hand, in the West, a familiarity with the external side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>seems, in many cases, to have prevented any attempt to go below the
surface, and to have caused men to be satisfied with vague philanthropic
sentimentality, effecting nothing, and leading nowhere.</p>

<p class='c028'>What then is this Universal Brotherhood, which is the main spring of
Theosophy? and what are its results?</p>

<p class='c028'><em>Socialism</em> as preached in this 19th century it certainly is not. Indeed,
there would be little difficulty in shewing that modern materialistic
Socialism is directly at variance with all the teachings of theosophy.
Socialism advocates a direct interference with the results of the law of
<em>Karma</em>, and would attempt to alter the dénouement of the parable of the
talents, by giving to the man who hid his talent in a napkin, a portion of
the ten talents acquired by the labour of his more industrious fellow.</p>

<p class='c028'>Neither is it true that in practical benevolence is the whole idea of
universal brotherhood exemplified, though doubtless that unselfish and
unceasing work for the good of mankind, which is true philanthropy
must of necessity be one result of it. The philanthropist may be, and no
doubt often is, a true theosophist in all but name, though there is still much
of what may be called unintelligent benevolence, the result of a mere
emotional impulse; and again there is much that is the result of very decided
and very narrow sectarian views, to which it would be absolutely
impossible to apply the epithet universal. The devotion and self-sacrifice
shown in many individual instances by Christian missionaries of various
denominations, may be taken as fairly exemplifying philanthropy both
of the unintelligent and the narrow type. They are prepared to make
any sacrifice for what they believe to be the ultimate good of humanity,
and in that sense are practising what some others only preach, namely
true unselfishness, but they are often hampered by an intellectual inability
to view both sides of the question, and fail thereby to acquire that understanding
of, and sympathy with the difficulties and the wants of those
whom they are endeavouring to aid, which are necessary preliminaries to
any work of lasting usefulness. In a word, they too often fail to realise
that unity in mankind which truly underlies all individualism. But
having said so much, it must be added that an understanding of the real
meaning of “Brotherhood” must entail active benevolence, that is to say
work for others in some form or other, upon every one who does not
wilfully thrust aside the obligation.</p>

<p class='c028'>Where then are we to look for the explanation, and how are we to
understand the spirit which must animate all true theosophists, if they
are to realise and follow out the first rule of the Society? Not surely
on the physical plane. Not by an attempt to force on the intellect as a
fact to be accepted, or more truly a pill to be swallowed, a belief in
similarities, equalities or identities, which have no existence. Only a
realisation of what truly constitutes man can help us to form a conception
of what brotherhood means.</p>

<p class='c028'>Man is a complex organism as he exists on our earth to-day. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>partly transitory, partly eternal; in one sense the creature of circumstances,
in another the creator of his own environment. But the true
man, the underlying individuality is a reflection of the Divine. We are
able to discern physical beauty, even when clad in rags. Is it impossible
that we should also recognise the beauty of the soul, though it be for a
time veiled beneath a gross material body? The physical body is indeed
nothing but the garment of the ego, the true man; that momentarily
suited to his needs and his deserts, the livery of his servitude, which
must be worn, in ever changing forms, till the moment of his final
emancipation. It is then beyond the physical, beyond the intellectual
man, that we must look for that fraternity, arising out of unity and
equality, which cannot be found on the purely material plane of existence.
The divine soul of man, in which is posited his true individuality,
is the real man, the immortal ego, which, through the accumulated experience
of many earth lives is marching onward through the ages to
its goal, reunion with the Infinite. What matters then the outward
semblance, which our senses know as man? Our æsthetic perception
may shrink from the rags, the dirt, the ugliness which belong to the
physical environment. Our moral nature may revolt at association
with vice, with low selfish courses of life, but within and behind all this
we must endeavour to realise the continual presence of the immortal ego,
one with us, as with all humanity, as sharing the divine nature, and ever
struggling, as we are struggling, on the upward path that leads to the
realisation of the Absolute. As Carlyle says in Sartor Resartus. “Mystical,
more than magical, is that communing of Soul with Soul, both
looking heavenward; here properly Soul first speaks with Soul; for only
in looking heavenward, take it in what sense you may, not in looking
earthward does what we can call Union, Mutual Love, Society, begin to be
possible.”</p>

<p class='c028'>It may be objected that in some cases it is impossible to recognise
even the glimmerings of those higher aspirations, which are the tokens
of the presence of the soul, the immortal ego. Such cases, however,
must be comparatively rare. Still there are beings—it is almost impossible
to call them human—who have so persistently concentrated all
their efforts on the gratification of their lower consciousness, as to sever
the frail link which binds them to their higher selves. Then the true
man is no longer present in the human form, and brotherhood becomes
an impossibility. But we may in truth almost ignore the existence of
this type of mankind, for even when an intellectual materialism seems to
be the sole ruling principle, we dare not deny the presence of that
capacity for higher things which must exist in all who can still truly be
called men.</p>

<p class='c028'>Surely then it is in this view of our relations to our fellow men, that
we shall find that guiding influence which may enable us to rise above
the sordid considerations of our ordinary earthly existence. It is no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>sectarian belief that is here advanced; it is the essence of the teaching
of Jesus, as it was of Gautama; nor is it a mere formula, to be accepted
as an article of faith, and then laid on the shelf. Once understood, it
must influence all who have sufficient strength of purpose to fight their
own lower selfish personalities, and must lead them to the practical
realisation of their aspirations towards true unselfishness and active
benevolence.</p>

<p class='c028'>But there lurks a danger even in the use of the word unselfishness. It
has been the text of sermons from every pulpit in Christendom for
centuries, and with what small results? No doubt the duty nearest at
hand must not be neglected, and it is the duty of every one to do what
he can to render those about him happier. But many stop there and
consider that all their work consists in the practice of self-abnegation in
their own small circle. Does not the broader view of human life here
set forth suggest a new sphere of usefulness, and therefore of duty? It
is for every man to determine what he can do for the good of humanity;
all are not equally gifted, but all can do something. Some theosophists
appear to be satisfied with intellectual study, or the development of their
own spiritual nature, and neither of these two courses is to be neglected;
but something more must be done. “It is more blessed to give than to
receive,” and the acquirement of knowledge brings with it the obligation
of spreading it. This is work from which none need shrink, and all who
truly desire to work for Theosophy, which is in the highest sense “the
religion of humanity,” will find the work ready to their hand, and be
able to assist in bringing the Light “to them that sit in darkness.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>Particular attention has been recently directed to this subject
of <em>Blood-Covenant</em> by the experiences of explorers in Africa,
who appear to have discovered in that Dark Land some of the
primitive facts the gory ghost of which has long haunted our European
mind in the Eschatological phase.</p>

<p class='c028'>Stanley, an especial sufferer from the practice, denounces the blood-brotherhood
as a <em>beastly cannibalistic ceremony</em>. “For the fiftieth time
my poor arm was scarified and my blood shed for the cause of
civilization.” As the writer of this book observes: “The blood of a
fair proportion of all the first families of equatorial Africa now courses
in Stanley’s veins; and if ever there was an American citizen who could
pre-eminently appropriate to himself the national motto ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>E pluribus
unum</i></span>,’ Stanley is the man.”</p>

<p class='c028'>In his book, Dr. Trumbull has collected a mass of data from a wide
range of sources to illustrate what he terms the “<em>Primitive rite of
covenanting by the inter-transfusion of blood</em>.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Trumbull is anxious to make the efficacy of the rite depend
upon the recognition of a vivifying virtue in the blood itself, as the
essence of life. But such recognition appears to have been remote
enough from the Primitive thought. The Aborigines were not Jews or
Christians. They gave of their life without always thinking of the
exact equivalent or superior value received. They gave it as the witness
to the troth they plighted and the covenant which they intended to
keep. His theory of interpretation is that there was a dominating and
universal conviction that the “blood is the life; that blood-transfer is
soul-transfer, and that blood-sharing, human or <em>divine</em>-human, secures an
inter-union of natures; and that a union of the human nature with the
divine is the highest ultimate attainment reached out after by the most
primitive, as well as the most enlightened, mind of humanity.”</p>

<p class='c028'>His collection of facts may serve a most useful purpose as eye-openers
to other people (and for other facts to follow), just as they appear to have
been to himself. The book is interesting, if not profound; and nothing
that follows in this article is intended to decry it, or to prevent the
readers of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> from looking into it if they do not feel too great a
“scunner” at sight of the gilded-gory illustration on the cover. But the
work is written by one who talks to us out of a window of Noah’s Ark,
and who still seems to think the Hebrew Bible is the rim of the universe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>We value and recommend the book solely for its facts, not for its
theories, nor for its bibliolatry.</p>

<p class='c028'>In all studies of this kind which make use of the word “Primitive,”
it is the fundamental facts that we first need; and next a first-hand
acquaintanceship with all the facts, so that we may do our own thinking for
ourselves and strike our light within by which we can read the facts
without, as the primary and essential procedure in the endeavour to
attain the truth.</p>

<p class='c028'>Also the facts may be genuine and honestly presented, yet the interpretation
may be according to an inadequate or a “bogus” theory.
The truth is that no bibliolator can be trusted to interpret the past of
our race now being unveiled by evolution. He is born and begotten
with the blinkers on. His mode of interpretation is to get behind us, to
lay the hands upon our eyes in front, and ask us to listen whilst he gives
us his views of the past! But the non-evolutionist cannot interpret
the past from lack of a true standpoint with regard to the beginnings or
rather the processes of becoming. He can begin anywhere and at any
time short of the starting-point. There is nothing for it but to break
away, and turn round to see for ourselves whether the traditionary
vision of the Blinkerists be true or false. The facts alone are the final
determinatives of the Truth. But we must have the whole of them
and not a few, whether judiciously or Jesuitically selected to
support a Christian theory. Whereas, the object and aim of this <a id='corr217.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='work'>work,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_217.23'><ins class='correction' title='work'>work,</ins></a></span>
the bias of the writer, and the trend of his arguments, are all on the
line of showing or suggesting that the blood-covenant was the result of
some innate instinct or divine revelation which prefigured and foreshadowed,
and may be taken to indicate and authorize, the Christian
scheme of atonement, and the remission of sin by the shedding of innocent
blood. The writer asserts that this primitive symbolism was
“<em>made a reality in Jesus Christ</em>” in whom “<em>God was to give of his blood
in the blood of his Son for the revivifying of the sons of Abraham in the
Blood of the Eternal Covenant</em>.” But it can be demonstrated that the
covenant by blood did not commence where Dr. Trumbull begins—with
a religious yearning God-ward for the establishing of a brotherhood
between the human nature and the Divine. The root-idea was not that
of an “inter-union of the spiritual natures by the inter-commingling of
blood for the sake of an inter-communion with deity.” That, at least,
was by no means the “<em>primitive</em> rite,” which the blood-covenant is here
called. The many forms of the blood-covenant can only be unified at
the root, <i>i.e.</i>, in the beginning, not at the end. They are not to be
understood apart from the primitive language of signs, as in Tattoo, the
very primitive biology of the early observers, and the most primitive
sociology of the Totemic times.</p>

<p class='c028'>Time was, and may be still, when the blood-covenant would often
serve as the one protection against being killed and eaten. Even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>cannibals will not partake of their own Totemic brothers. Also the
covenant was extended to certain animals which were made of kin and
held to be sacred as brothers of the blood.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Blood-covenant takes many forms besides that of the blood-brotherhood,
which are not to be explained by this writer’s theory of exchange.</p>

<p class='c028'>When the blood of an African woman accidentally spurted into the
eye of Dr. Livingstone, she claimed him for her blood relation, without
there being any exchange of blood for blood.</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Trumbull claims the Egyptians as witnesses to the truth of his
interpretation. But so far from their highest conception of “a union
with the Divine nature” being an inter-flowing and interfusion of blood,
the soul of blood was the very lowest, that is the first, in a series of seven
souls!</p>

<p class='c028'>Their highest type of the soul was the sun that vivified for ever
called Atmu, the Father Soul.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c013'><sup>[53]</sup></a> The bases of natural fact which lie
at the foundation of the Blood-covenant, preceded any and all such
ideas as those postulated by the writer as being extant from the first,
such as “a longing for oneness of life with God;” an “out-reaching
after inter-union and inter-communion with God.” There was no conception
of a one God extant in the category of human consciousness
when the rites of a blood-covenant were first founded. There could
be no atonement where there was no sense of sin or a breaking of the
law. All through, the writer is apt to confuse the past with the
present, and eager to read the present into the past.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c013'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>The real roots of matters like these are to be found only in certain
facts of nature which were self-revealing, and not in the sphere of concepts
and causation! And it is only when we can reach the natural genesis
of primitive customs and fetishtic beliefs, and trace their lines of descent,
that we can understand and interpret their meaning in the latest symbolical
and superstitious phase of religious rites. Nothing can be more
fatally false than to interpret the physics of the past by means of modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>metaphysic, with the view of proving that certain extant doctrines of
delusion are the lineal descendants of an original Divine revelation,
which has been bound up in two Testaments for the favoured few.</p>

<p class='c028'>The blood-covenant is undoubtedly a primitive rite; but the author
of this work does not penetrate to its most primitive or significant
phases. These are not to be read by the light of Hebrew revelation,
but by the light of nature if at all. Many primitive customs and rites
survived amongst the Semites, but they themselves were not amongst
the aboriginal races of the world. We have to get far beyond their
stage to understand the meaning of the myths, legends, rites, and
customs, that were preserved by them as sacred survivals from the
remoter past. The symbolical and superstitious phases of custom
cannot be directly explained on the spot where we may first meet with
them in going back. In becoming symbolical they had already passed
out of their primary phase, and only indirectly represent the natural
genesis of the truly primitive rite. I have spent the best part of my
life in tracking these rites and customs to their natural origin, and in
expounding the typology and symbols by which the earliest meaning
was expressed.</p>

<p class='c028'>What then was the root-origin of a blood-covenant? The primary
perceptions of primitive or archaic men included the observation that
they came from the mother, and first found themselves at her breast.</p>

<p class='c028'>Next they saw that the child was fleshed by the mother, and formed
from her blood, the flow of which was arrested to be solidified, and take
form in their own persons. Thus the red amulet which was worn by
the Egyptian dead, was representative of the blood of Isis, who came
from herself, and made her own child without the fatherhood, when men
could only derive their blood and descent from the mother. This
amulet was put on by her, says Plutarch, when she found herself <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>enceinte</i></span>
with Horus, her child, who was derived from the mother alone, or was
traced solely to the blood of Isis. Primitive men could perceive that
the children of one mother were of the same blood. This, the first form
of a blood-brotherhood, was the first to be recognised as the natural fact.
Uterine brothers were blood-brothers. The next stage of the brotherhood
was Totemic; and the mode of extending the brotherhood to the
children of several mothers implies, as it necessitated, some form of
symbolic rite which represented them as brothers, or as typically becoming
of the one blood. Here we can track the very first step in
sociology which was made when the typical blood-brotherhood of the
Totem was formed in imitation of the natural brotherhood of the
mother-blood. The modes and forms of the Covenant can be identified
by the Totemic mysteries, some of which yet survive in the crudest
condition. The brotherhood was entered at the time of puberty; that
is, at the time of re-birth, when the boy was re-born as a man, and the
child of the mother attained the soul of the fatherhood, and was permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to join the ranks of the begetters. The mystery is one with that
of Horus, child of the mother alone, who comes to receive the soul of
the father in <em>Tattu</em>, the region of establishing the son as the father,
which is still extant in the mysteries, and the symbolism of <em>Tattoo</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>This re-birth was enacted in various ways by typically re-entering the
womb. One of these was by burial in the earth, the tomb or place of
re-birth being the image of the maternal birth-place all the world over.
Thus when the Norsemen or other races prepared a hole under the
turf, and buried their cut and bleeding arms to let the blood flow, and
commingle in one as the token of a covenant, they were returning
typically to the condition of uterine twins, and the act of burial for the
purpose of a re-birth was a symbolical mode of establishing the social
brotherhood upon the original grounds of the natural brotherhood of
blood. Thus the blood-covenant did not originate in the set transfusion
or inter-fusion of blood. In the Totemic mysteries the pubescent lad
was admitted by the shedding of his blood, with or without any interchange.
The blood itself was the symbol of brotherhood, and the
shedding of it was the seal of a covenant.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nor was this merely because flesh was formed of blood, or the first
men were made of the mystical red soil, as with the <em>aarea</em> of the
Tahitians, or the red earth of the Adamic man. Most of these primitive
rites, the Blood-Covenant included, had their starting-point from the
period of puberty. It was at this time the lads who were not brothers
uterine were made brothers of the Totem at what was termed the
festival of young-man-making. The proper period for circumcision, or
cutting and sealing, as still practised by the oldest aborigines, is the
time of puberty, the natural coming of age. It is then they enter the
Totemic Brotherhood. Now in Egyptian, the word <em>khet</em> or <em>khut</em> =
cut, means to cut and to seal. <em>Khetem</em> is to enclose, bind, seal, and is
applied to sealing. The same root passes into Assyrian and Hebrew as
<em>Khatan</em>, <em>Katam</em> or <em>Chatan</em>, with the same meaning. In Arabic,
<em>Khatana</em> is to circumcise. Cutting and sealing are identical as the
mode of entering into a Blood-Covenant. Circumcision was <em>one</em> form of
the sealing, but there were various kinds of cuts employed, and
different parts of the body were scarified and tattooed. In the primary
phase, then, the blood-brotherhood was established by the shedding of
blood; the register was written in blood, and instead of the covenant
being witnessed by the seal of red wax, it was stamped in blood.</p>

<p class='c028'>The reason for phallic localization is to be sought in the fact that the
young men not only entered the Brotherhood by the baptism of blood,
they were also received into the higher ranks of the fathers, and sworn
in to live an orderly, legal and cleanly life, henceforth, as the pro-creators
and loyal preservers of the race.</p>

<p class='c028'>But this was not the only clue directly derived from nature. There is
another reason why blood should have become the sacred sign of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>covenant. Amongst many primitive races blood, or the colour red, is
the symbol of <em>Tapu</em>, the sign of sanctity. The bones of the dead were
covered with red ochre as a means of protection by the most widely
scattered races in the world. The stamp of a red hand on the
building, or a crimson daub upon the gravestone will render them sacred.
The Kaffirs will wash their bodies with blood as a protection against
being wounded in battle. The colour of robin-redbreast still renders him
<em>tapu</em> or sacred to English children.</p>

<p class='c028'>Blood having become a sign of that which is true and sacred, on
account of the Covenant, it is then made the symbol of all that is sacred.
It can be used for the purpose of anointing the living or the dead, can
be the seal of the marriage or other ceremonies and rites of covenanting.
It is the primæval token of <em>tapu</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>As I have elsewhere shown, blood was sworn by as the type of that
which was true, the primary one of the typical Two Truths of Egypt.
It was so in all the mysteries, and is so to-day, including the mysteries
of Masonry. I have suggested the derivation of the masonic name from
the Egyptian <em>Sen</em> = son, for blood and brotherhood. The working Mason
in Egyptian is the <em>makh</em> (<em>makht</em>) by name. <em>Makh</em> means to work, inlay
by rule and measure. We see that <em>makh</em> modifies into <em>mâ</em> for measure,
and for that which is just and true.</p>

<p class='c028'><em>Mâ-sen</em> = Mason, would denote the true brotherhood; and as <em>sen</em> is
also blood, the true brotherhood as the blood-brotherhood would be the
masons in the mystical or occult sense. Red is the colour of <em>Mâ</em> or
Truth personified, and <em>sen</em> is blood. Blood is sworn by because it is the
colour of truth, or the true colour. Now in old English the word <em>seng</em>
means both “blood” and “true.” Here, then, we find the origin of the
oath, which constitutes the supreme expression in the vocabulary of our
English roughs, when they use the oath of the blood-covenant, and
swear by the word “bloody!” When they wax emphatic, everything
they say becomes “bloody true.” This is the exact equivalent of
“seng it is” for “it is true.” According to the primitive mysteries, this
mode of swearing, or establishing the covenant, was sacred whilst kept
piously secret, and it becomes impious when made public or profane.
Such mysteries were very simply natural at first, and it was this primitive
simplicity and nearness to nature which demanded the veil to
protect them from the gaze of the later consciousness. Time was when
the English felon would carry a red handkerchief with him to the
scaffold, and hold it in his hand as a signal that he had betrayed no
secrets, but died “bloody true,” or true blood.</p>

<p class='c028'>These customs were symbolical, but there is a hint of the blood-covenant
beyond them—a hint received direct from Nature herself—call
it revelation if you please. In the first rude ethics we find that the
time for the sexes to come together was recognised by the intimation of
nature, made in her own sign-language at the period of feminine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>pubescence. Nature gave the hint, and a covenant was established.
Henceforth, the child that could not enter that covenant would be
protected from brutal assault, and was allowed, or rather compelled, to
run about unclothed in token of her exemption. It is here in the
swearing-in and covenanting of the sexes at the time of pubescence
that we discover another real and most secret, <i>i.e.</i>, sacred root of the rite.</p>

<p class='c028'>The self-revelation made by nature to primitive man was very
primitive in its kind. She not only demonstrated that the blood was
the life, or that the life passed away with the letting out of the blood,
but in another domain, which our author has not entered, she showed
that blood was, and how it was, the future life. Blood was the
primary witness to the future life which the child received from the
mother. It was the token of the time when the female could become
the bearer of that future life which took flesh and form in her blood.</p>

<p class='c028'>The blood-covenanting of the primitive races is still a part of the
most elaborate system of making presents, which are the express
witnesses of proffered troth and intended fealty. The most precious or
sacred things are parted from in proof. The best is given on either
side. And in the offering of blood, they were giving their
very life, that in which the best attains supremacy. But these
primitive rites can never be truly read except by those who are
deeply grounded in the fact, and well acquainted with the evidence,
that sign-language was primordial, that gestures preceded verbal speech,
and acting was an earlier mode of representing than talking. Primitive
men could only <em>do</em> that which we can <em>say</em>. In Egyptian that which is
<em>said</em> is <em>done</em>. And in these primitive customs and religious rites we see
the early races of men performing in pantomime the early drama of
dumb or inarticulate humanity. And it seems as if this primitive
language could produce an impression and reach a reality that are
unapproachable by means of words. The significance of the teaching
went all the deeper when it was incised in the flesh and branded into
the blood. For example, what a terrific glimpse of reality is revealed by
the fact that the Malagasy make their sign of a blood-covenant by an
incision in the skin that covers the bosom, and this opening with its
utterance of blood is called <em>ambavfo</em>, the “mouth of the heart.” Thus
the covenant is made in the blood, which is the very life, uttering itself
with the mouth of the heart. In Egyptian the covenant, the oath, and
the life, have the same name of <em>Ankhu</em>; and the greatest oath was to
swear by the life or the blood of the Pharaoh. The primitive mode was
to slash the flesh and let the hot blood spout and speak for itself with
the “mouth of the heart,” the utterance of the living letter and red seal
of the wound, as true witness.</p>

<p class='c028'>No verbal covenant or written record of the modern races has ever
had the full force and effect of these modes of covenanting amongst
the primitive people of the past. The moderns do not keep their word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with anything like the inviolable sanctity of the aborigines; when once
they are sworn to fealty, the covenant is almost never broken. Few
things in poetry are more pathetic than the story related of Tolo, a
chief of the Shastika Indians on the Pacific Coast. In the year 1852
he entered into a tribal treaty with Colonel McKee and was desirous of
making a covenant for life in some way that could not possibly be
violated. Instead of exchanging blood he proposed a transfer of their
own two personal names. Henceforth he was to be known as McKee,
and the Colonel as Tolo. But the treaty was discarded, the covenant
was not kept by the American Government. In reply, the Indian cast
off the title of McKee and refused to resume his own tarnished and
degraded name of Tolo! He considered that his very identity was lost
by this mode of losing his good name! I doubt whether 1,800 years of
Christianity have evolved in the later races of men a consciousness of
truth, probity, and loyalty, so quick and profound as that!</p>

<p class='c028'>The writer of this book remains stone-blind to its own teachings with
regard to the doctrine of survivals, and of the past persisting as a pattern
for the present.</p>

<p class='c028'>To quote his own words, he rejoices in the “<em>blessed benefits of the
covenant of blood</em>,” and is still a fervent supporter of the great delusion
inculcated by the gospel of ruddy gore.</p>

<p class='c028'>The doctrine is fundamentally the same whether the Greek murderer
was cleansed from his guilt by the filthy purification of pig’s blood or the
modern sinner is supposed to be washed white in the Blood of the
Lamb.</p>

<p class='c028'>As I had already written in my “Natural Genesis,” “the religious
ritual of the moderns is crowded like a kitchen-midden with the refuse
relics of customs that were natural once, and are now clung to as if they
were supernatural in their efficacy because their origin has been unknown.
Indeed, the current masquerade in these appurtenances of the
past is as sorry a sight to the archaic student as are the straw crowns
and faded finery of the kings and queens whose domain is limited to the
lunatic asylum.” Dr. Trumbull endorses the doctrine that “<em>Mortals
gave the blood of their first-born sons in sacrifice to the Supreme Being,
then the Supreme Being gave the blood of his first-born male in sacrifice</em>”
for men; and there you have the covenant of blood in its final form!</p>

<p class='c028'>It is true that first-born children were offered in sacrifice just as the
first take of fish was returned to the waters with a lively sense of future
favours from the Typhonian power thus propitiated, but where is the
sense of talking about the thought of an intercommunion with the
divine nature through a blood-union with God as a concept in the mind
of primitive man? It is true the recognized nature-powers, or devils of
physical force, were invoked with blood, but what was the status of these
powers when the beasts of blood were their representatives on earth, and
the blood, which is the life, was given to the Serpent, for instance, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>likeness of life itself because it sloughed its own skin and manifested
the enviable power of self-renewal? The profounder and more fundamental
our researches, the more clearly does it become apparent that we
have been victimised by the unsuspected survival of the past in the
present, and that the veriest leavings of primitive man have been palmed
off upon us by the ignorant as sacred mysteries and revelations guaranteed
to be original and divine. Continually we find that our errors of belief are
based upon very simple truths that have been misunderstood through a
misinterpretation of primitive matters and modes of representation by
means of modern ignorance. The blood-covenant of the aboriginal races
has undoubtedly survived and culminated as Christian in the frightful
formula, “Without blood there is no remission of sin.” Not merely the
blood of beasts or human creatures this time, but the ruddy life and
ichor of a supposed Divine Being, who was made flesh on purpose to
pour out the blood for Almighty vengeance to lap in the person of a
gory ghost of God. One of the seven primal powers in Egypt was
represented by the hawk, because it drank blood. One of the Seven in
Akkad was the vampire. And this type of blood-drinking has been
divinised at last as the Christian God.</p>

<p class='c028'>Pindar says: “It is impossible for me to call one of the blessed gods
a cannibal.” But the Christian scheme makes the Only God a cannibal,
who offers the flesh and blood of his own Son and Very Self as
sacrificial food made sacred for his followers. Such a god is, in two
senses, <em>chimerical</em>. How natural an accompaniment is the picture of
the Crucified Christ to the Zuni saying, “My Father, this day shalt thou
refresh thyself with blood!” Such a doctrine is but an awful shadow of the
primitive past—the shadow, so to say, of our old earth in the very far-off
past—that remains to eclipse the light of Heaven to-day, and
darken the souls of men in the present through the survival of savage
spiritualism in its final Christian phase, where the extant doctrines are
little more than an ignorant perversion of the most primitive knowledge.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is in this final and not in the primitive phase that we shall identify
the <a id='corr224.33'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='irrationalty'>irrationality</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_224.33'><ins class='correction' title='irrationalty'>irrationality</ins></a></span>, the impiety, the disgusting grossness of Mythology
under the surface of theological varnish and veneer. The only senselessness
is in the survival of Myths without their sense.</p>

<p class='c028'>Lastly, it is observable that in the genuine rite the covenant-makers
always bled <em>directly</em> and suffered each for themselves. Later on we find
that other victims were substituted by purchase, by fraud, or by force;
hence the blood-covenant by proxy. Now the Christian scheme is that
which culminated in the blood-covenant and atonement by proxy.
“<em>His offspring for his life he gave</em>,” is said of an Akkadian ruler who
sacrificed his own son as an expiatory offering to save himself from the
consequences of his own sin. And this doctrine of the despicable, this
type of the fatherhood, is elevated to the status of divinity by Dr.
Trumbull. To quote his own words, the inspired author of the narrative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>found in the Hebrew Genesis shows “Abel lovingly and trustfully
reaching out toward God with <em>substitute</em> blood!”</p>

<p class='c028'>And there began for the Historic Christians that vast perversion of a
primitive custom which culminated at last in the Christian doctrine of
vicarious sacrifice, based upon the mythology of the Old Testament
being literalized in the New. Now we have the ludicrous spectacle of
salvation by means of a rite which has lost all the manhood, all the
morality, all the meaning, that was put into it by the despised races of
uncivilized men.</p>

<p class='c028'>The eucharistic rite is incredibly primitive when really understood.
The bread and wine of the Christian sacrament still represent the male
spirit and the female source of life. The “Blood of Jesus,” which was
to be “drink indeed,” is identical with the “Blood of Bacchus,” which
preceded historic Christianity, and has been substituted for the human
or animal blood of the earlier mysteries. Imbibing the blood of the
Christ did not originate in any historic or personal transaction. Also
the blood of Christ, or Mithras, or Horus, employed in drinking the
covenant, was preceded by the blood of Charis. In some of the
Gnostic mysteries we have the proof that the first form of the saving
blood was feminine, not masculine at all. Irenæus presents us with a
picture of profound interest from the anthropological point of view.</p>

<p class='c028'>He tells us how Marcus performed the eucharistic rite with the blood
of Charis, instead of the blood of Christ. He handed cups to the women
and bade them consecrate these in his presence. Then, by the use of
magical incantation, “Charis was thought to drop her own blood into the
cup” thus consecrated. (B. I. 13, 2.)</p>

<p class='c028'>There is but one known fact in natural phenomena which will fitly
account as <em>Vera Causa</em> for a monthly Sacrament, celebrated every
twenty-eight days, or thirteen times to the year; which fact was commemorated
by the Blood-Covenant of Charis ( <i>Vide</i> “Nat. Gen.” V. ii.
section 12, for proofs). This kind of blood-covenant can be paralleled in
the Yain or Yonian mysteries of India.</p>

<p class='c028'>When rightly understood, the eucharist is a survival of the “beastly
cannibalistic ceremony,” whether considered as the blood of Charis or
the blood of Christ, or partaken of as the red Tent wine or the “bloody
wafer” of Rome.</p>

<p class='c028'>We welcome Dr. Trumbull’s contribution on the subject, although he
has but “breathed a vein” of it, because these rites and customs have to
be unveiled, and when they are at last exposed in all the simplicity of
naked nature the erroneous ideas read into them, the delusive inferences
drawn from them, the false illusions painted upon the veil
that concealed the truth about them, will be doomed to pass away.
To explain the true is the only effectual mode of exploding the
false.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>“What are the senses called astral, in reality? Are they not really
spiritual, seizing on the inner essence of things and interpreting it.
The ordinary psychic or clairvoyant surely does not use the astral
senses? Yet he sees things which we do not see. It would be well to explain
this.”</p>

<div class='c020'>B. K.</div>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> The senses called astral in the comments on “Light on the Path” are the
senses which perceive the inner essence, certainly; which are cognisant of the
life underlying every form of matter. The ordinary psychic or clairvoyant only
perceives other forms of matter than those we ordinarily see, and perceives
them as a child perceives the forms in this world at first, without understanding
their meaning. The astral senses carry beyond matter, and enlighten man with
regard to any form of life which especially interests him. They show the poet
painter, and composer the things they express to other men, who regard these
great ones as beings of another order—beings with the gift of genius. So
they are, and the vigour of that genius carries them on into the inner life
where meaning, and harmony, and the indefinable all-desired are to be perceived.
Wordsworth saw it in nature, he recognised the “spirit in the woods”—not the
wood-nymphs but the divine spirit of peace which teaches a lesson in life.
Richard Jeffries saw it in nature, too, as perhaps no other man ever has seen it;
through the finite visible world he perceived the infinite invisible one, and before
he died he had begun to know that the visible world does not exist. Turner, perhaps,
is the only parallel. By the invisible world I must repeat again that I do
not mean what the spiritualists call by that name—a new world of other forms. I
mean the formless world. It is the farthest limit man’s <em>consciousness</em> can reach
to; and only the pure and star-like soul can become even aware of its existence.
It is not man’s divine nature, but the man who enters it with any reverence for
the great miracle of life can only do so by the aid of his divine nature, whether
as a poet, a painter, or an occultist. The soul which enters it without reverence
is unable to endure its extreme rarity of atmosphere and turns to the psychic-astral
in which to live; such men become madmen and suicides, more or less
pronounced, as men do who refuse to dwell in any form of physical life but
the grossest and simplest. There is some law of life which impels men onward—call
it evolution or developement or what you will; and a man can no more
go downwards without suffering than a tree can be placed with its branches in
the ground, instead of its roots, without discomfort, and in the end, death.</p>

<p class='c028'>I propose to use two phrases which have been suggested to me; the <a id='corr226.40'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='physchic'>psychic</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_226.40'><ins class='correction' title='physchic'>psychic</ins></a></span>-astral
and the divine-astral. This seems the only way to make my meaning clear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>for the word astral has two meanings, its own proper derivative one, from the
Sanskrit <em>stri</em> to strew light, and that given it by the use of all occultists.
Paracelsus appropriated the word for all things sidereal, subject to the moon
and stars, part and parcel of this material universe, even though formed as
Dryden says of “purest atoms of the air.” In this sense the spiritualists and
psychics have the right of custom to use it as they do, to describe their world
of finer forms. In this meaning an astral shape is the form of the human soul,
still in possession of the passions which make it human; and the astral senses
perceive not the subtle and supreme glory which Shelley seized on in
Prometheus, but a region full of shapes and forms differing but little from
those we now wear, and still distinctly material.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “astral man” in the “Comments on Light on the Path” should have
been written the divine-astral man, according to this evident difference of
meaning between the present writer and all other writers on occultism.</p>

<p class='c028'>1. “There is a law of nature which insists that a man shall read these mysteries
for himself. Will all men seeking the occult path read these mysteries alike,
or will each man find the interpretation peculiarly adapted to his own phrase of
development. No two men read the mysteries contained in the Bhagavat
Gita quite alike, each gains the glimpses of light which he is able to assimilate
and no more.”</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> This seems to be rather a statement of a truth than a question which can
be answered in any way other than putting it into different words, perhaps not
so good.</p>

<p class='c028'>2. “Is the outer world the reflection of the world within? like a shadowed
reproduction in clumsy form, the inner being reality?”</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> This is what should be. But materialists have brought their sense of reality
into the shadowed life.</p>

<p class='c028'>3. “How is the intuition to be developed which enables one to grasp swift
knowledge?”</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> To me no way is known but that of living the life of a disciple.</p>

<p class='c028'>4. “Can the laws in super-nature only act on their own plane, or can their
reflection be brought down intact in their own purity to govern physical life.”</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> Surely this must be so; yet rarely, for when it is accomplished the man
would be divine, a Buddha!</p>

<p class='c028'>5. “To be incapable of tears”—does not that mean that the physical emotions,
being merged into the inner physical, that tears are impossible as being an
outward phase of the physical nature—whereas the psychical emotions, to use
a physical term are vibratory.</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> “The whole of ‘Light on the Path,’ is written in an astral cipher” is stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>at the outset of the “comments;” the word “tears” does not refer to physical
tears in any way.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is the only word which will convey any idea whatever of the moisture of
life, that which bursts from the human soul in its experience of sensation and
emotion, and in the passion of its hunger for them.</p>

<p class='c028'>Referring to the comments on “Light on the Path,” in the first number of

must be incapable of tears, and yet no eyes incapable of tears can see,” <i>i.e.</i>, see
good or God, is not truer and stronger than its part?</p>

<p class='c028'>“Therefore the soul of the occultist must become stronger than joy and
greater than sorrow” I presume means that he must not <em>seek</em> joy or <em>fear</em> sorrow,
not that he may not enjoy nor sorrow?</p>

<p class='c028'>The phrase by itself may read “Before the eyes can see they must be incapable

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> Once more I must refer to the preliminary statement in the comments that
“Light on the Path,” is written in an astral cipher, and that tears do not
mean the tears of the physical body, but the rain drops that come from the
passion-life of the human soul. These being stayed for ever, the astral sight
is no longer blinded or blurred. Divine love and charity then find room, when
personal desire is gone. Joy and sorrow, <em>for oneself</em>, then drop naturally into
another place than that which they filled before.</p>

<p class='c028'>(1.) I desire very strongly to obtain conquest over “self;” would my using
the occult means for so doing, which apparently to me lie without the <em>ordinary</em>
experience of Christians, necessitate my sacrificing any iota of my belief in the
<em>power of Christ</em>?</p>

<p class='c028'>(2.) If I submit myself to the occult conditions under which the four first
rules in “Light on the Path” may be “engraved on my heart and life;” will
these conditions permit me to <em>pray throughout</em> for the Divine help and strength
of the Eternal Christ, who has passed the portal, opened the “way,” and whom
I believe to be the “Master of Masters,” the “Lord of Angels”?</p>

<p class='c028'>(3.) Do the words—“the disciple” ... “must then so shut the gates of
his soul that <em>no comforter</em> can enter there nor any enemy”—mean, that we are
wilfully to exclude ourselves from any desire for the sympathy, strength, and
support of the spirit of One who said “No man cometh unto the Father but by
Me,” and who drank the cup of agony to the very dregs for love of the Brotherhood?</p>

that you do appeal to “<em>Its</em>” power throughout.</p>

<p class='c028'>(3.) Man can find no comforter save in the Divine Spirit within himself.
Does not the tale of the life of Jesus illustrate this, looking at it from one point of
view? In what dread isolation he lived and died; His disciples, even those
who were most beloved by Him, could not reach His spirit in its sublime
moments, or in the hours of its keenest suffering. So with every one who
raises himself by effort above the common life of man, in however small a
degree. Solitude becomes a familiar state, for nothing personal, not even a

<p class='c028'>“Is there any chance of self-deception? May one enter the path so gradually
as to be conscious of no radical change, representing a change of life or stage

lasting sorrow, or an all-absorbing joy, but who in the midst of both joy and
sorrow strives to remember others, and to feel that he hardly deserves the joy,
and that his sorrow is meagre in the presence of the great all-pain? How is

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> It is difficult for such a one to know anything of what lies beneath the surface

one immutable sign; the sense that personal joy or sorrow no longer exist.

<h4 class='c023'>“ESOTERIC BUDDHISM.”</h4>

<p class='c035'>“As the Editors of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> kindly invite questions concerning Theosophy
and kindred subjects, an honest enquirer into these matters would welcome an
answer to the following difficulty:</p>

<p class='c028'>“In his book on ‘Esoteric Buddhism,’ Mr. Sinnett states that souls or
spirits pass the long interval between the one incarnation and another in a sort
of quiescent, and at least half-unconscious, state, losing enough of their identity
to preclude their carrying any recollection of one incarnation on to the next.
In his novel, “Karma,” Mr. Sinnett represents one character, Mrs. Lakesby,
gifted with more than usual powers, as being very fond, when she has the
chance, of allowing her spirit to escape from the trammels of the body and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>meeting the spirits of departed—that is, dead friends—“and others” on the
Astral plane where she holds agreeable converse with them.</p>

<p class='c028'>“How are these two statements reconcilable?</p>

<p class='c028'>“October 22nd, 1887.</p>
<div class='c020'>N. D.”</div>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Sinnett would probably reply that the answer could only be given fully
by reprinting all that he has written in various published works, on the conditions
of existence in Kama-Loca, and Devachan, and on the higher and
lower aspects of <em>Self</em>. The normal course of events will conduct a human being
who quits the material body through Kama-Loca to the Devachanic state, in
which Mrs. Lakesby would not be able to interview him. But while in Kama-Loca
she might at least imagine she did this, and, perhaps not too wisely, <a id='corr230.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in dulge'>indulge</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_230.11'><ins class='correction' title='in dulge'>indulge</ins></a></span>
in the practice of so doing. If we remember rightly the Baron, in
“Karma,” who is represented as knowing a good deal more than Mrs. Lakesby,
gifted as she is, throws some discredit upon her view concerning the Astral
plane and its inhabitants. At the best when a clairvoyant can gain touch with a
soul in Kama-Loca, it is the lower self remaining there, though it has left the
body, that she deals with. And though that lower self may be very recognisable
for people who have known it in the earthly manifestation, it will be <em>lower</em> than
the lower self of earth and not higher because ethereal. That is to say on
earth the living man is more or less under the guidance of his higher self. But
the higher has no longer any business to transact with the lower self of Kama-Loca,
and does not manifest there at all.</p>

<p class='c028'>Finally it must always be remembered that a romance, even though written
by an Occultist, is a romance still, designed to suggest broad conceptions rather
than to expound scientific and doctrinal details.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Being courteously invited to address any questions bearing on the matter
contained in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> to the Editors, Madame la Marechale Canrobert would

and the starry spirit? Is it that soul which is again alluded to (page 91) as the
animal soul, in opposition to the Divine soul? Second, What are the external
forms of the individualised being spoken of also on page 91?”</p>

<p class='c028'><i>A.</i> The human soul, that which is subject to human passions, but which
can also yearn towards the nobility of the Divine soul, is that which is spoken
of on page 11. The starry spirit is the Divine-astral. The animal soul is that
which animates the mere physical life, the unintelligent existence of the body.

<h4 class='c023'>THE REAL HISTORY OF THE ROSICRUCIANS.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c013'><sup>[55]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c035'>Mr. Waite’s new book will be welcomed by that large class of readers
who regard occultism, alchemy, and all like studies with antagonism
and suspicion. Secret societies supposed to deal with such subjects
are, from their point of view, better exposed and ridiculed than treated with
respect or taken seriously. The author of the present volume does not, however,
cast disrespect on occult science, nor does he discuss the Rosicrucians in
a spirit of levity or disdain. He recognises that there may be, and probably is,
a grand spiritual and moral philosophy in the higher aspects of true alchemy,
but in these pages he treats the subject of the society from the historical, and
not at all from the mystical side, and confines himself to tracing its recorded
history, its rise, fall, and <i>raison d’etre</i>. The conscientious study of these records
relating to the Brotherhood has brought Mr. Waite to the conclusion that
they do not support the traditions which up to the present have surrounded
the society with a veil of unknown antiquity and have endowed its members
with a halo of marvellous wisdom. It is these conclusions that will charm the
incredulous, and may probably blind them to the indications of an undercurrent
of belief in the reality of occult science, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, which the author has
evidently not desired to suppress. To investigate and disentangle the network
of facts, theories, and traditions which must necessarily envelope a society that
up to the commencement of the seventeenth century had not been heard of by the
general public is no easy task, and Mr. Waite may be congratulated upon the
calm and judicial spirit with which he has treated his subject, as well as upon
the moderation with which he advances his own views. To be able to gather
from these open records how far the members of such a society may have held
in their keeping some of the inner secrets of Nature is of course impossible to
ordinary humanity. The real character and aims of such an association can be
known only to passed Initiates. In his preface Mr. Waite says: “I claim to
have performed my task in a sympathetic but impartial manner, purged from
the bias of any theory, and above all uncontaminated by the pretension to
superior knowledge, which claimants have never been able to substantiate.”
This statement is fully justified in the pages of the book under review. Its
value does not lie so much in any new presentation of the facts or theories pertaining
to the Rosicrucians, and which are so frequently distorted by ignorant commentators,
as in the compact and systematic arrangement of some of the principal
writings available. He has brought together not only the leading works
of the various writers known, or supposed to be Rosicrucians, but he has also
collected the criticisms and conjectures on these current at the time of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>appearance in Germany, together with others of a much more recent date.
Consequently the reader has before him almost all the information of this
description he could require, and which he could not obtain for himself except
by the expenditure of time and trouble that very few are either able or willing
to give.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is not surprising that Mr. Waite should have satisfied himself that the
Rosicrucians have no sort of claim to the reverence and admiration in which
scholars and mystics have held them up to the present time. But these
conclusions will form only one more of other proofs to students of esotericism,
that the task of writing a true and real history of a secret occult society from
its records, where such exist, is an impossibility. For even when such societies
left reliable information of their pursuits, aspirations, and beliefs, the language
employed has always been of such a character as to baffle entirely the ordinary
exoteric reader, whether he were historian, literateur, or scientist. Such literature
can be interesting only to the student on the track of esoteric knowledge,
or to one who has in a great measure acquired the meaning conveyed, for himself
in other ways. This method of giving to the world, as it were, the proceeds,
of life-long research in the realms of unseen Nature, has been adopted by
alchemists, magicians, priests, and hierophants from all ages. None but those
who were sufficiently steadfast in the cause of truth could read and understand
what was thus written. The numerous and minute directions for the working of
spells and cures, etc., left by Paracelsus, and which are apparently as straight
forward and practicable as the receipts in a modern cookery book, would turn
out probably much less successful in the hands of an amateur, no matter how
highly educated on the physical plane, than the more delicate dishes taken
from such receipts manipulated by an entirely inexperienced servant. For
these elaborate instructions are given in terms that appeal simply to the
material senses of those who are in search of power rather than of wisdom,
whereas the real effort to produce the result has to take place on the Astral
plane of nature. The spiritual or soul side of man, must be awakened and
utilised, before the Philosopher’s stone, or the elixir of life, can be discovered.</p>

<p class='c028'>The comprehension of the potentialities of the human body, their nurture
and eventual utilisation for purely unselfish ends and spiritual, <i>i.e.</i>, real wisdom,
is, or ought to be, the work of all secret occult societies. But to return to Mr.
Waite’s book. The popular notion that this Brotherhood is of great, almost
incredible antiquity, is utterly condemned by him. He fails to find any documentary
evidence to show that it existed before the early part of the seventeenth
century, and argues that the well-known antiquity of the Rose and Cross
in symbolism is no proof of the antiquity of a society using them “at a period
subsequent to the Renaissance.” Granting that the device of the Rose and
Cross, as emblems of a particular order or brotherhood, does not guarantee its
equal antiquity with them, still it must be admitted that these symbols bearing
as they do a profoundly esoteric interpretation, and being adopted by a society
of a distinctly occult character, is an argument in support of the theory that
the founder or originator of this order had some reason other than fancy for
thus labelling his fraternity. Elsewhere he says, “I have shown indisputably
that there was no novelty in the Rosicrucian pretensions, and no originality in
their views. They appear before us as Lutheran disciples of Paracelsus.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The author here seems to be not entirely logical in his deductions. When
he states that he has not met in his search with either letters, records, or papers
that mention or suggest the existence of such a society before the <a id='corr233.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='seventeeth'>seventeenth</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.3'><ins class='correction' title='seventeeth'>seventeenth</ins></a></span>
century, he is of course, as a historian, safely ensconced from attack. In this
capacity as an impartial seeker after facts, it is outside the area of his work in the
absence of data to theorise on probabilities. When, however, in dealing with the
manifestoes of the seventeenth century, he finds therein evidence that shows him
the Brotherhood had no back history or ancestry, his conclusions are open to
criticism. The very fact of the want of originality and novelty in the views,
aims and aspirations set forth in the “Fama,” and “Confessio” surely gives
strength to the theory that holds to the antiquity of the society, rather than
to its being the outcome of a spontaneous effort. All true students of mysticism
have good reason to believe, even when they do not absolutely know,
that the various schools of occultism considered from their highest or most
spiritual and abstract teaching, lead to the same goal. They may be called by
different names, and their methods in minor details may not be the
same, but the wisdom <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au fond</i></span> is identical. Therefore when Mr. Waite
casts discredit upon the Rosicrucians for not advertising novelties in their
manifesto, in the mystical line of thought, he reminds us of a man who in
making up his mind on the value of a violin, decides that it cannot be of great
age, because it emits only the same set of sounds that such musical instruments
have been accustomed to give forth from time immemorial.</p>

<p class='c028'>As far as can be ascertained by studying the state of thought and society at
the period when the Rosicrucians were first heard of in Europe, this particular
order manifested itself as an antidote to the general tendency towards the
material side of alchemy, which honey-combed the educated classes of
Germany. Wonder-seekers then, as now, did not apprehend that ethics, both
social and spiritual, are the fundamental basis of real wisdom, <a id='corr233.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='consquently'>consequently</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.27'><ins class='correction' title='consquently'>consequently</ins></a></span> the
great cry was for power, no matter of what description, for the accumulation of
wealth. The craving for arcane knowledge, so widely diffused, and which
alchemists were truly known to possess, had gradually degenerated into a purely
selfish desire for the secret of transmuting metals. To supply this eager demand
charlatans of every description rushed to the front professing to teach all who
joined their standards, <i>i.e.</i>, who could pay the necessary fee, how to turn
common metal into pure gold. The craze for this power was so universal, the
motive of it so unspiritual, that in order to stem the tide of the folly, and to
checkmate the impostors who were bringing discredit on the <em>Sacred Art</em>, the
“Fama” was issued by a body of people who took as their symbols the Rose
and Cross. From this point of view the Rosicrucians historically come before
the world in the light of a group of Reformers.</p>

<p class='c028'>Different people interpret in different ways the two manifestoes—the “Fama”
and “Confessio.” Mr. Waite appears to place great importance on the
adherence to Christian dogmas observable in the wording of these papers. But
in taking the documents literally, he seems to overlook the necessity that all
writers were under, in those troubled times, of pandering to the narrow and
prejudiced minds of the leaders of the so called Christian Church, by apparently
adhering to the Ritual. Naturally, the author of the “Fama” worded it in such
a manner as to avoid persecution or suspicion of heresy. Those to whom it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>was really addressed would not be misled by its tone of orthodoxy, and the
general public and the church would pass it by as harmless. Moreover, as Mr.
Waite remarks further on, “the philosophical and scientific opinions and pretentions
of the Rosicrucian Society have more claim on our notice” than their
theology. Speaking again of the school of thought current at the time this
organization was floated, and which he tells us the Rosicrucians followed, he
says.... “Mystics in an age of scientific and religious materialism, they
were connected by an unbroken chain with the theurgists of the first Christian
centuries, they were alchemists in the spiritual sense, and the professors of a
Divine Magic. Their disciples, the Rosicrucians, followed closely in their footsteps,
and the claims of the “Fama” and “Confessio” must be reviewed in the
light of the great elder claims of alchemy and magic.” In spite of this, Mr.
Waite judges the Society, it would appear, by what he admits to be the minor
and less important side of its object, for he speaks of it eventually, as a body of
“pre-eminently learned men and a Christian Sect.” We will not stop to consider
the probability or possibility of a body of “pre-eminently learned men,” being at
the same time a “Christian Sect.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Having thus deprived the Rosicrucians of the dignity, reverence and romance,
that cling round great antiquity; having saddled them with the tenets and
dogmas of conventional mediæval christianity, Mr. Waite next proceeds to
demolish their emblems, or at all events, to deny that they attached any esoteric
interpretation to them. He says ... “The whole question of the Crucified
Rose, in its connection with the Society is one of pure conjecture, that no
Rosicrucian manifestoes, and no acknowledged Brother have ever given any
explanation concerning it, and that no presumption is afforded by the fact of
its adoption, for the antiquity of the Society, or for its connection with Universal
Symbolism.” Allowing for the necessity in writing a history of a mystical
society of taking the documents as they stand, Mr. Waite rather ignores
the fact that the evidence for the statement above is of a negative character.
That in their manifestoes and records there appears no explanation of their
emblems, hardly justifies the conclusion that they were incapable of giving any.
It would indeed have been a new departure in the annals of Secret Societies
if the founders of this particular order had left behind the explanation of their
signs and symbols. The study and interpretation of symbology forms a most
important element in the education of occult disciples, and therefore to assume
that the projectors of this organisation should be unaware of the mystic reading
of the Rose and Cross, is a hypothesis that no student of mysticism could
accept.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is, on the whole, generally assumed by those who have taken any pains to
investigate the evidence, that Johann Valentin Andreas was the author of the
“Fama,” the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Confessio Fraternitatis</cite></span>, and also of the “Chymical Marriage” of
Christian Rosencreutz, and to that extent he must be looked upon exoterically as
the founder of the Rosicrucian Society, as first known to history. He was deeply
versed in mystic studies and alchemy, and had besides a widespread reputation
as a scholar and learned man. His “Chymical Marriage,” to anyone with even a
slight acquaintance with alchemical literature, reveals him as one who had
penetrated deeply into some of the mysteries of nature. Consequently, he must
have been well aware that the Rose and Cross bore a profoundly occult signification.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Considering the man himself, the character of his studies, and his well
known devotion to alchemy and mysticism, it is certainly more reasonable to
suppose that he took those emblems (presuming he had any choice in the
matter) for his society, not as some suggest, because they happened to form a
part of his own armorial bearings, or that the Rose and Cross on a Heart was used
by Martin Luther, but because he recognised their full value and importance
as symbols of cosmic evolution.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Waite seems, on the whole, to agree with the idea that Andreas was the
author of the “Fama” and “Confessio,” and regards the “Chymical Marriage” as
undoubtedly his production. He also allows that the latter pamphlet can only
have been the work of a man deeply embued with alchemical speculations, a
mystic and follower of Paracelsus. How then can he ask us to believe that the
Society formed under such auspices was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au fond</i></span>, nothing but a Christian sect
based on the teachings of Martin Luther! To the public at large these theories
may perhaps appear sufficiently plausible in face of the wording of those parts
of the manifestoes that touch on theology. To students of esotericism, however,
such conclusions will be absolutely unacceptable, and we can not allow to pass
without comment Mr. Waite’s hypothesis that the Rosicrucian Society, as it first
came before the world, was simply a society for the propagation of the
deteriorated Christianity of the middle ages. No mystic, whether calling himself
Rosicrucian, Cabbalist, Theosophist, Christian, or Buddhist, would either, intellectually
or spiritually, accept the narrow dogmas and intolerant views of the
Christian church, even when to some extent cleansed of many of its grosser
abuses by the energy of Martin Luther’s Reform.</p>

<p class='c028'>The two lines of thought are essentially different. In the case of the
Christian, no matter of what denomination, his thoughts are bound down and
paralysed within the rigid circle drawn by the materialistic reading of Christ’s
birth, life, and death. The true occultist takes those episodes spiritually or
allegorically, finding their correspondences within himself as well as in the
universe. To say that a human being can at one and the same time be an
occultist, and a sectarian Christian, is as impossible as to speak of a Christian
Jew. A true Christian, <i>i.e.</i>, one who understood and followed absolutely the
teachings of Jesus, would be also a true Rosicrucian. Membership of particular
churches or societies does not unfortunately endow the individual immediately
with the virtue, knowledge or power, that is the theoretical goal of his initial
action. Such membership is, or may be a step in the direction of Divine Wisdom,
but one step does not carry him to the summit of the path. Men do not
become either Rosicrucians, Christians, or Theosophists merely by joining the
Societies working under those particular names. But certain tendencies in their
temperaments urge them into the special Society where the mode of thought
seems best fitted to help them, to realise the magnitude and glory of the
possibilities inherent in their own souls.</p>

<p class='c028'>Between the humanity of to-day, and the development of a sixth sense, which
will enable it to perceive what now is imperceptible, there is but a thin veil of
obstructing matter, metaphorically speaking. This veil is even now being continually
pierced by psychics, first in one direction then in another, letting in
through these tiny openings glimpses of the invisible world around. In a little
while the veil will be worn away entirely, and the humanity of that future time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>will doubtless wonder how the humanity of this age, which we find so enlightened,
could have been so unintuitive and blind to the most important side
of their natures. Until the race however has by soul evolution attained to this
sixth sense, real histories of Mystical Societies can hardly be hoped for. Members
of such Societies, who by study and training have attained some degree of
knowledge <em>may</em> not disclose the secrets, non-members cannot get at them. The
reading-classes of to-day may, after reading Mr. Waite’s book, think they have
learnt something of the body of people called Rosicrucians, and until now
supposed to have some claim to arcane knowledge. The students of occultism
will know that the vital part of the subject is and must remain ever impregnable,
excepting from its esoteric side.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>“NINETEENTH CENTURY SENSE.”</h4>

<p class='c035'>Sense! What is ”sense”? A word meaning either little or much; simple
and clear to the understanding, or various and carrying with it many
connotations. It is one or other according as we measure the depth, the
thoroughness, or the <em>reality</em> of the knowledge acquired. From a purely
physical “sensation” we may trace the word through endless shades of
signification; through “good” sense, “sound” sense, through the artistic and
finer sensibilities, the “moral” sense, till it loses itself in the vague hint of a
dim, unformed consciousness, pointing the way to the new world of the “inner
senses.”</p>

<p class='c028'>All these meanings and more are connoted by the phrase “Nineteenth
Century Sense;” <a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c013'><sup>[56]</sup></a> for, by a daring metaphor, the tools which modern science
places at our disposal are considered as “senses,” and even the faculty and
power of analysis is sometimes included under the word.</p>

<p class='c028'>Beginning with the simplest, the reader is led on to the most astounding
<a id='corr236.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='phenonema'>phenomena</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_236.27'><ins class='correction' title='phenonema'>phenomena</ins></a></span> of modern spiritualism in the first thirty-seven pages of this strange
work. The author depicts in vivid language his own experiences, and the
triumphs of phenomena produced by one of his personal friends, in a style
which is often quaint and striking, though at times the writer’s disregard of
many of the accepted rules of composition becomes—to say the least—irritating.
But the matter of his book earns forgiveness for the manner in
which it is formulated.</p>

<p class='c028'>After carrying his reader to a pitch of interest and expectation as to the
phenomena he describes, Mr. Darby suddenly plunges him into the frozen sea
of scepticism by stating that all the phenomena produced under what seemed
the strictest test conditions, were produced by conjuring and legerdemain, and
by explaining the physical causes of some of the visions he has so graphically
described. It will suffice to cite a single instance in illustration. “The
President of the American Branch of the Indian Society of Theosophists
(Professor Coues) ... spent an evening with me some time back in
conversation on the subject of psychical phenomena. We parted at midnight.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>At seven o’clock the next morning I suddenly awoke, beholding the astral of
the professor standing at my bed-side.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This vision Mr. Darby explains by reference to the fact of the persistence of
retinal images and the super-excitability of the nerves and brain. “Astral
projections,” he concludes, “are of precisely similar significance.” We would
feel obliged to the eminent American professor of physiology referred to if he
would give his written opinion on the question thus raised. For Theosophists
have heard of persons whose brains were in complete repose and fully occupied
otherwise who have also seen the astral form of Professor Coues. How’s
this?</p>

<p class='c028'>He concludes, nevertheless, that materialistic agnosticism is the only
“creed”? Far from it. This portion of the book is purely introductory; it
forms the five door-steps leading to the Spiritus Sanctus—the laboratory of the
Divine Spirit.</p>

<p class='c028'>From this black depth of doubt and confusion, the reader is lifted suddenly
into the clear ether, and his feet are placed on the “Rosicrucian Way.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Whether called “Rosicrucian,” or by whatever other name, the “Way” is the
“Way of Life,” the path which leads to freedom, to wisdom, to true living.
Whole pages might well be quoted; a few aphorisms must suffice.</p>

      <div class='line'>“A thing is to the sense that uses it what to the sense</div>
      <div class='line'>It seems to be; it is never anything else.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>Many passages recall “Light on the Path,” though Mr. Darby probably never
saw that book; but life is one, and <em>true</em> occultism is one.</p>

<p class='c028'>Speaking of mankind as divided into two classes, <em>men</em> in whom is the Holy
Ghost, the Divine Spirit or the <em>Logos</em>, he says:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“With people self-wise or over-sufficient, with the proud and the uncharitable, with all who are
<em>without understanding as to the common good being the only good</em>, with him who fails to see that gifts
<em>are in men as almoners only</em>—with all these the Holy Ghost is absent, otherwise so lacking in measure
as to be incapable of making itself felt.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The italicised passages give the key-note of the true science and art of
living. To quote again:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Settled into tranquillity by entirely satisfactory recognition of noumenon through phenomenon
an end is reached where instrument is prepared and ready for use. Analysis has shown the Rosicrucian
what he is; more than this—what he can become as to his Ego. If out of his understanding, he puts
office [<em>the service of others</em>.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>] before self, he learns directly of the God, as the God comes to live
in and to make use of him.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Proving to one’s self that one’s self is God”; and again, “God ... the One is in all; the All
is in one.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The next chapter contrasts strangely with the one just quoted from—strangely,
that is, to the outer sense. The one full of deep philosophy, of questionings of
God, the Self, the World, clothed in the profound and significant paradoxes in
which wisdom finds expression; the other an idyll, a sketch of nature, deeply
coloured by the influence of Walt Whitman, whose <em>style</em>, perhaps, has had too
great an influence on Mr. Darby, who has caught its jerky and unpleasant
strings of detached sentences.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>This is Chapter V.; Chapter VI. deals with Matter in its relation to the Ego,
the spirit of the treatment being indicated by the following conclusion:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“That there shows itself, out of a process of exclusion, conducted even only so far as the analysis
of matter, a something which is not matter. The analysis demonstrates the something to be of
individual signification; further, that it is to it what a flute or other instrument is to harmony.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The final words express a purely occult doctrine, which is worked out at
length in the succeeding chapter on the Ego.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is the fundamental thought of the book, the last fifty pages of which
describe the author’s individual experiences in nascent psychic development.</p>

<p class='c028'>They are not of a very striking character, but exhibit with sufficient clearness
the early forms of this new growth. Unfortunately, the author seems to have
lacked the desire to pursue the road thus opened to him, and the final pages of
his work are but a lame and halting conclusion to a remarkable production.</p>

<p class='c028'>The book is well adapted for those who stand halting on the verge of
mysticism, while for the student who has advanced further, its pages may serve
as a means for helping others.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'><span class="blackletter"><span class='sc'>From the Note Book of an Unpopular Philosopher</span></span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c032'>I am Sternly Rebuked for some
remarks made in the last number. My
reflections with regard to the respective
value of Mussulman and Christian
pledges exchanged, as also on the doubtful
propriety of zoological symbolism in
the Churches—are pronounced wantonly
wicked and calculated to hurt the tender
feelings of Christian readers—if any.
Protestant England—it is solemnly urged—is
full of truly good men and women, of
sincere church-goers, who “walk in the
ways of the Lord.” No doubt there
are such, and no doubt they do, or
try to, which is a step in advance of
those who do not. But then none of
the “righteous” need recognize their faces
in the mirror presented by the “Unpopular
Philosopher” only to the <em>unrighteous</em>.
And again—-</p>

<p class='c028'>“<span class='sc'>The Ways of the Lord</span>....”
The ways of <em>which</em> Lord? Is the jealous
Lord of Moses meant, the God who thundered
amidst the lightnings of Sinai, or
the meek “Lord” of the Mount of Olives
and Calvary? Is it the stern God that saith
“<em>vengeance is mine</em>,” and who must be
“<em>worshipped in fear</em>,” or the “man-God”
who commanded <i>to love one’s neighbours
as oneself</i>, <i>to forgive one’s enemies</i> and <em>bless
those who revile us</em>? For the ways of the
two Lords are wide apart, and can never
meet.</p>

<p class='c028'>No one who has studied the Bible can
deny for one single moment that a large
proportion (if <em>happily</em> not all) of modern
Christians walk indeed “in the <em>ways</em>
of the Lord”—Number I. This one
is the “Lord” who <em>had respect unto
Abel</em>, because the meat of his sacrifice
smelt sweet in his nostrils; the “Lord”
who commanded the Israelites to <em>spoil</em> the
Egyptians of their jewels of silver and
gold;<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c013'><sup>[57]</sup></a> also to “<em>kill every male among the
little ones</em>,” as “<em>every woman ... but
all the women children</em> (virgins) <em>to keep
alive for themselves</em>” (Numb. XXXI., 17,
<i>et seq.</i>); and to commit other actions too
coarse to be repeated in any respectable
publication.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hence the modern warriors who achieve
such feats (with the modern improvement
occasionally, of shooting their enemies
out of the mouths of big guns) walk,
most undeniably, “in the ways” of the
Lord of the Jews, but <em>never in the
ways</em> of Christ. So does the modern
trader who keeps the Sabbath most
rigorously, attending Divine Service
thrice on that day, after treating during
the whole week his hired clerks as the
brood of Ham “who shall be their (Shem
and Japhet’s) servants.”</p>

<p class='c028'>So does, likewise, he who helps himself,
David-like, to a Bath-Sheba, the wife
of Uriah, without the least concern
whether he simply robs or kills the Hittite
husband. For he has every right to take
for his sampler “a friend of God”—the
<em>God</em> of the old covenant.</p>

<p class='c028'>But will either of these pretend they
walk in the ways of their Lord of
the <em>new</em> Dispensation? Yet, he who
raises his voice in a protest against
the “ways” of the Mosaic God,
therefore, in favour of those preached by
the very <em>antithesis</em> of Jehovah—the meek
and gentle “Man of Sorrow”—he is forthwith
set up on the pillory and denounced
to public opprobrium as an <em>anti-Christian</em>
and an Atheist! This, in the face of the
words: “<em>Not every one that saith unto me
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven; but he that doeth the will of
my Father which is in Heaven.... And
every one that heareth these words of mine,
and doeth them not, shall be likened unto
a foolish man, which built his house upon
the sand.... and great was the fall
thereof!</em>”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>The “Will of My Father?”</span>
Is this “Father” identical with the God
of Mount Sinai and of the Commandments?
Then what is the meaning of
the whole Chapter V. of Matthew, of the
Sermon on the Mount, in which every one
of these Commandments is virtually
criticised and destroyed by the new
amendments?</p>

<p class='c028'>“<i>Ye have heard that it hath been said
‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth’; but I say unto you that you resist
not evil</i>,” etc.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Glance at the big centres of our
Christian civilisations. Look at the jails,
the court and the prison-houses, the
tribunals, and the police; see the distress,
with starvation and prostitution as its
results. Look at the host of the men of
law and of judges; and then see how far
the words of Christ, “Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, Judge not
that ye be not judged,” apply to the
whole structure of our modern civilised
life, and how far we may be called
<em>Christians</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>How well the commandment—“<em>He that
is without sin among you, let him first
cast a stone</em>”—is now obeyed, may be
seen by following day after day, the law
reports for slander, calumny and defamation.
Obedience to the injunction,
and warning against the sin of offending
children, “<em>these little ones</em>,” of whom is the
Kingdom of Heaven, is found in the
brutal treatment of fatherless children on
the streets by the Christian police, of
other children by their parents, and
finally, in the merciless flogging of wee
bits of culprits driven to crime by their
own parents and starvation. And is it
those who denounce such an anti-Christian
spirit in legislation, the
Pharisaical church and society, who
shall be branded for speaking the truth?
The magistrate, who has sworn on the
Bible—contrary to Christ’s express injunction—to
administer justice; the pious
defaulter, who swears falsely on it, but
cannot be convicted; the sanctimonious
millionaire who fattens on the blood and
sweat of the poor; and the aristocratic
“Jezebel” who casts mud from her
carriage wheels on her “fallen” sister,
on the street, a <em>victim perchance, of
one of the men of her own high caste</em>—all
these call themselves Christians.
The <em>anti-Christians</em> are those who
dare to look behind that veil of respectability.</p>

<p class='c028'>The best answer to such paradoxical
denunciation may be found in one of
“Saladin’s” admirable editorials. The
reader must turn to <cite>The Secular Review</cite>
for October 22nd, 1887, and read some
pertinent reflections on “The Bitter Cry
of Outcast London,” and the “Child-thieves”
flogging. Well may a “heathen
Chinee” or a “mild Hindu” shudder
in horror at the picture in it of that
“drawing of blood” out of the baby-bodies
of infant thieves. The process
is executed by a Christian policeman
acting under the orders and in the
presence of a righteous Christian
magistrate. Has either of the two ever
given a thought during the “child-torture”
to the words of their Christ:
“<em>Whosoever shall offend one of these
little ones, it is better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck
and he were cast into the sea</em>”?</p>

<p class='c028'>Yes, they <em>are</em> walking “in the ways of
the God of Israel”! For, as “<em>it repented
the Lord that he had made man</em>”
so wicked and so imperfect, that “Lord”
drowned and destroyed him “from the
face of the Earth,” without more ado.
Verily so, “<em>both man and beast, and the
creeping thing and the fowls</em>,” though
the latter had neither sinned, nor were
they “wicked.” And why shouldn’t the
righteous men on Earth do likewise? It
repents the Christian citizens of pious
<span class='sc'>Lugdunum</span> perchance also, that they
create the starving little wretches, the
foundlings abandoned to vice from the
day of their birth? And the truly good
Christian men, who would believe themselves
damned to hell-fire were they to
miss their Sabbath Service, forbidden by
law to drown <em>their</em> creatures, resort to the
next best thing they can; they “draw
blood” from those little ones whom their
“Saviour” and Master took under his
special protection.</p>

<p class='c028'>May the shadow of “Saladin” never
grow less, for the fearless honest words
of truth he writes:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“And whose blood was in the veins of
these two boys? Whose blood reddened
the twigs of the birch? Peradventure
that of the magistrate himself, or of the
chaplain of the prison. For mystical
are the grinding of the wheels of the mill
of misery. And God looks on and
tolerates. And I am accounted a heretic,
and my anti-Christian writings are produced
against me in a Court of Justice
to prevent my getting justice, because
I fail to see in all this how Christianity
“elevates” woman and casts a “halo
of sacred innocence round the tender
years of the child.” So be it. I have
flung down my gage of battle, and the
force of bigotry may break me to death;
but it shall never bend me to submission.
Unsalaried and ill-supported, I fight as
stubbornly as if the world flung at my
feet its gold and laurels and huzzas; for
the weak need a champion and the
wronged an avenger. It is necessary
that Sham find an opponent and
Hypocrisy a foe: these they will find in
me, be the consequences what they may.</p>

<div class='c020'>“<span class='sc'>Saladin.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c028'>This is the epitomized history of the
“Unpopular Philosopher”; aye, the story
of all those who, in the words of “Lara,”
know that “Christianity will never save
humanity, but humanity may save
Christianity,” <i>i.e.</i>, the ideal spirit of the
Christos-Buddha—of <span class='sc'>Theosophy</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Not all the members of the Theosophical Society are Theosophists; nor are the
members of the so-called Christian Churches all Christians, by any means. True
Theosophists, as true Christians, are very, <em>very</em> few; and there are practical Theosophists
in the fold of Christianity, as there are practical Christians in the Theosophical
Society, outside all ritualistic Christianity. “Not every one that saith unto me ‘Lord,
Lord,’ shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father.”

<p class='c028'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. “This” Theosophy is not a religion, but rather <em>the</em> <span class='fss'>RELIGION</span>—if one. So far, we
prefer to call it a philosophy; one, moreover, which contains every religion, as it is the
essence and the foundation of all. Rule III. of the Theos. Body says: “The Society

“presence,” for “coming,” and “the consummation of the age,” now standing for
“the end of the world,” have altered, of late, the whole meaning, even for the most

and it was so with the early Christians. <em>Sophia</em> of the Gnostics, and the third Sephiroth

<p class='c028'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. There are several remarkable cycles that come to a close at the end of this century.
First, the 5,000 years of the Kaliyug cycle; again the Messianic cycle of the
Samaritan (also Kabalistic) Jews of the man connected with <em>Pisces</em> (Ichthys or “Fish-man”
<em>Dag</em>). It is a cycle, historic and not very long, but very occult, lasting about 2,155
solar years, but having a true significance only when computed by lunar months. It
occurred 2410 and 255 B.C., or when the equinox entered into the sign of the <em>Ram</em>, and
again into that of <em>Pisces</em>. When it enters, in a few years, the sign of <em>Aquarius</em>,
psychologists will have some extra work to do, and the psychic idiosyncrasies of
humanity will enter on a great change.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. The earliest Christian author, Justin Martyr, calls, in his first Apology, his co-religionists
<em>Chrestians</em>, χρηστιανοι—not Christians.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. “Clemens Alexandrinus, in the second century, founds a serious argument on this
paranomasia (lib. iii., cap. xvii., p. 53 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>et circa</i></span>), that all who believed in <i>Chrest</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, “a
good man”) both are, and are called Chrestians, that is, good men,” (Strommata,
lib. ii. “Higgins’ <cite>Anacalypsis</cite>.”) And Lactantius (lib. iv., cap. vii.) says that it is only
through <em>ignorance</em> that people call themselves Christians, instead of Chrestians:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<i>qui proper ignorantium errorem cum immutata litera Chrestum solent dicere</i>.”</span></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. It is but fair to St. Paul to remark that this contradiction is surely due to later
tampering with his Epistles. Paul was a Gnostic himself, <i>i.e.</i>, A “Son of Wisdom,”
and an Initiate into the true <em>mysteries of Christos</em>, though he may have thundered (or
was made to appear to do so) against some Gnostic sects, of which, in his day, there were
many. But his Christos was not Jesus of Nazareth, nor any living man, as shown so
ably in Mr. Gerald Massey’s lecture, “Paul, the Gnostic Opponent of Peter.” He
was an Initiate, a true “Master-Builder” or adept, as described in “Isis Unveiled,”
Vol II., pp. 90-91.</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. The extraordinary amount of information collated by that able Egyptologist shows
that he has thoroughly mastered the secret of the production of the <cite>New Testament</cite>.
Mr. Massey knows the difference between the spiritual, divine and purely metaphysical
Christos, and the made-up “lay figure” of the carnalized Jesus. He knows also that
the Christian canon, especially the <cite>Gospels</cite>, <cite>Acts</cite> and <cite>Epistles</cite>, are made up of fragments
of gnostic wisdom, the ground-work of which is <em>pre-Christian</em> and built on the
<span class='fss'>MYSTERIES</span> of Initiation. It is the mode of theological presentation and the interpolated
passages—such as in Mark xvi. from verse 9 to the end—which make of the
Gospels a “magazine of (<em>wicked</em>) falsehoods,” and throw a slur on <span class='sc'>Christos</span>. But the
Occultist who discerns between the two currents (the true gnostic and the <em>pseudo</em>
Christian) knows that the passages free from theological tampering belong to archaic
wisdom, and so does Mr. Gerald Massey, though his views differ from ours.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. “The key to the recovery of the language, so far as the writer’s efforts have been
concerned, was found in the use, strange to say, of the discovered integral ratio in
numbers of diameter to circumference of a circle,” by a geometrician. “This ratio
is 6,561 for diameter and 20,612 for circumference.” (Cabalistic MSS.) In one of

his Lecture on “The Seven Souls of Man,” he writes (p. 21):—</p>

<h3 class='c018'>“LUCIFER” TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, <br /> GREETING!</h3>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>My Lord Primate of all England</span>,—</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>We make use of an open letter to your Grace as a vehicle to
convey to you, and through you, to the clergy, to their flocks,
and to Christians generally—who regard us as the enemies of
Christ—a brief statement of the position which Theosophy occupies in
regard to Christianity, as we believe that the time for making that
statement has arrived.</p>

<p class='c028'>Your Grace is no doubt aware that Theosophy is not a religion, but a
philosophy at once religious and scientific; and that the chief work, so
far, of the Theosophical Society has been to revive in each religion its
own animating spirit, by encouraging and helping enquiry into the true
significance of its doctrines and observances. Theosophists know that
the deeper one penetrates into the meaning of the dogmas and ceremonies
of all religions, the greater becomes their apparent underlying
similarity, until finally a perception of their fundamental unity is reached.
This common ground is no other than Theosophy—the Secret Doctrine
of the ages; which, diluted and disguised to suit the capacity of the
multitude, and the requirements of the time, has formed the living kernel
of all religions. The Theosophical Society has branches respectively
composed of Buddhists, Hindoos, Mahomedans, Parsees, Christians,
and Freethinkers, who work together as brethren on the common
ground of Theosophy; and it is precisely because Theosophy is not a
religion, nor can for the multitude supply the place of a religion, that the
success of the Society has been so great, not merely as regards its growing
membership and extending influence, but also in respect to the performance
of the work it has undertaken—the revival of spirituality in
religion, and the cultivation of the sentiment of <span class='fss'>BROTHERHOOD</span> among
men.</p>

<p class='c028'>We Theosophists believe that a religion is a natural incident in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>life of man in his present stage of development; and that although, in
rare cases, individuals may be born without the religious sentiment, a
community must have a religion, that is to say, <em>a uniting bond</em>—under
penalty of social decay and material annihilation. We believe that no
religious doctrine can be more than an attempt to picture to our present
limited understandings, in the terms of our terrestrial experiences, great
cosmical and spiritual truths, which in our normal state of consciousness
we vaguely <em>sense</em>, rather than actually perceive and comprehend; and a
revelation, if it is to reveal anything, must necessarily conform to the
same earth-bound requirements of the human intellect. In our estimation,
therefore, no religion can be absolutely true, and none can be
absolutely false. A religion is true in proportion as it supplies the
spiritual, moral and intellectual needs of the time, and helps the development
of mankind in these respects. It is false in proportion as it hinders
that development, and offends the spiritual, moral and intellectual
portion of man’s nature. And the transcendentally spiritual ideas of the
ruling powers of the Universe entertained by an Oriental sage would be as
false a religion for the African savage as the grovelling fetishism of the
latter would be for the sage, although both views must necessarily be true
in degree, for both represent the highest ideas attainable by the respective
individuals of the same cosmico-spiritual facts, which can never be
known in their reality by man while he remains but man.</p>

<p class='c028'>Theosophists, therefore, are respecters of all the religions, and for the
religious ethics of Jesus they have profound admiration. It could not
be otherwise, for these teachings which have come down to us are the
same as those of Theosophy. So far, therefore, as modern Christianity
makes good its claim to be the <em>practical</em> religion taught by Jesus, Theosophists
are with it heart and hand. So far as it goes contrary to those
ethics, pure and simple, Theosophists are its opponents. Any Christian
can, if he will, compare the Sermon on the Mount with the dogmas of
his church, and the spirit that breathes in it, with the principles that
animate this Christian civilisation and govern his own life; and then he
will be able to judge for himself how far the religion of Jesus enters into
his Christianity, and how far, therefore, he and Theosophists are agreed.
But professing Christians, especially the clergy, shrink from making this
comparison. Like merchants who fear to find themselves bankrupt, they
seem to dread the discovery of a discrepancy in their accounts which
could not be made good by placing material assets as a set-off to spiritual
liabilities. The comparison between the teachings of Jesus and the
doctrines of the churches has, however, frequently been made—and often
with great learning and critical acumen—both by those who would
abolish Christianity and those who would reform it; and the aggregate
result of these comparisons, as your Grace must be well aware, goes to
prove that in almost every point the doctrines of the churches and the
practices of Christians are <em>in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>We are accustomed to say to the Buddhist, the Mahomedan, the
Hindoo, or the Parsee: “The road to Theosophy lies, for you, through
your own religion.” We say this because those creeds possess a deeply
philosophical and esoteric meaning, explanatory of the allegories under
which they are presented to the people; but we cannot say the same thing
to Christians. The successors of the Apostles never recorded the <em>secret
doctrine</em> of Jesus—the “mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven”—which it
was given to them (his apostles) alone to know.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c013'><sup>[58]</sup></a> These have been
suppressed, made away with, destroyed. What have come down upon
the stream of time are the maxims, the parables, the allegories and the
fables which Jesus expressly intended for the spiritually deaf and blind
to be revealed later to the world, and which modern Christianity either
takes all literally, or interprets according to the fancies of the
Fathers of the secular church. In both cases they are like cut flowers:
they are severed from the plant on which they grew, and from the root
whence that plant drew its life. Were we, therefore, to encourage
Christians, as we do the votaries of other creeds, to study their own
religion for themselves, the consequence would be, not a knowledge of the
meaning of its mysteries, but either the revival of mediæval superstition
and intolerance, accompanied by a formidable outbreak of mere lip-prayer
and preaching—such as resulted in the formation of the 239 Protestant
sects of England alone—or else a great increase of scepticism, for
Christianity has no esoteric foundation known to those who profess it.
For even you, my Lord Primate of England, must be painfully aware
that you know absolutely no more of those “mysteries of the kingdom
of Heaven” which Jesus taught his disciples, than does the humblest
and most illiterate member of your church.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is easily understood, therefore, that Theosophists have nothing to
say against the policy of the Roman Catholic Church in forbidding, or
of the Protestant churches in discouraging, any such private enquiry
into the meaning of the “Christian” dogmas as would correspond to the
esoteric study of other religions. With their present ideas and knowledge,
professing Christians are not prepared to undertake a critical
examination of their faith, with a promise of good results. Its inevitable
effect would be to paralyze rather than stimulate their dormant
religious sentiments; for biblical criticism and comparative mythology
have proved conclusively—to those, at least, who have no vested interests,
spiritual or temporal, in the maintenance of orthodoxy—that the
Christian religion, as it now exists, is composed of the husks of Judaism,
the shreds of paganism, and the ill-digested remains of gnosticism and
neo-platonism. This curious conglomerate which gradually formed
itself round the recorded sayings (λογια) of Jesus, has, after the
lapse of ages, now begun to disintegrate, and to crumble away from the
pure and precious gems of Theosophic truth which it has so long overlain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and hidden, but could neither disfigure nor destroy. Theosophy
not only rescues these precious gems from the fate that threatens the
rubbish in which they have been so long embedded, but saves that
rubbish itself from utter condemnation; for it shows that the result of
biblical criticism is far from being the ultimate analysis of Christianity,
as each of the pieces which compose the curious mosaics of the Churches
once belonged to a religion which had an esoteric meaning. It is only when
these pieces are restored to the places they originally occupied that their
hidden significance can be perceived, and the real meaning of the dogmas
of Christianity understood. To do all this, however, requires a knowledge
of the Secret Doctrine as it exists in the esoteric foundation of
other religions; and this knowledge is not in the hands of the Clergy,
for the Church has hidden, and since lost, the keys.</p>

<p class='c028'>Your Grace will now understand why it is that the Theosophical
Society has taken for one of its three “objects” the study of those
Eastern religions and philosophies, which shed such a flood of light upon
the inner meaning of Christianity; and you will, we hope, also perceive
that in so doing, we are acting not as the enemies, but as the friends of
the religion taught by Jesus—of true Christianity, in fact. For it is only
through the study of those religions and philosophies that Christians
can ever arrive at an understanding of their own beliefs, or see the
hidden meaning of the parables and allegories which the Nazarene told
to the spiritual cripples of Judea, and by taking which, either as
matters of fact or as matters of fancy, the Churches have brought the
teachings themselves into ridicule and contempt, and Christianity into
serious danger of complete collapse, undermined as it is by historical
criticism and mythological research, besides being broken by the sledge-hammer
of modern science.</p>

<p class='c028'>Ought Theosophists themselves, then, to be regarded by Christians as
their enemies, because they believe that orthodox Christianity is, on the
whole, opposed to the religion of Jesus; and because they have the
courage to tell the Churches that they are traitors to the <span class='sc'>Master</span> they
profess to revere and serve? Far from it, indeed. Theosophists know
that the same spirit that animated the words of Jesus lies latent in the
hearts of Christians, as it does naturally in all men’s hearts. Their
fundamental tenet is the Brotherhood of Man, the ultimate realisation of
which is alone made possible by that which was known long before the
days of Jesus as “the Christ spirit.” This spirit is even now potentially
present in all men, and it will be developed into activity when human
beings are no longer prevented from understanding, appreciating and
sympathising with one another by the barriers of strife and hatred
erected by priests and princes. We know that Christians in their lives
frequently rise above the level of their Christianity. All Churches
contain many noble, self-sacrificing, and virtuous men and women, eager
to do good in their generation according to their lights and opportunities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and full of aspirations to higher things than those of earth—followers
of Jesus in spite of their Christianity. For such as these, Theosophists
feel the deepest sympathy; for only a Theosophist, or else a person of
your Grace’s delicate sensibility and great theological learning, can justly
appreciate the tremendous difficulties with which the tender plant of
natural piety has to contend, as it forces its root into the uncongenial
soil of our Christian civilization, and tries to blossom in the cold
and arid atmosphere of theology. How hard, for instance, must it not
be to “love” such a God as that depicted in a well-known passage by
Herbert Spencer:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The cruelty of a Fijian God, who, represented as devouring the souls of
the dead, may be supposed to inflict torture during the process, is small, compared
to the cruelty of a God who condemns men to tortures which are eternal....
The visiting on Adam’s descendants through hundreds of generations, of
dreadful penalties for a small transgression which they did not commit, the
damning of all men who do not avail themselves of an alleged mode of obtaining
forgiveness, which most men have never heard of, and the effecting of reconciliation
by sacrificing a son who was perfectly innocent, to satisfy the assumed
necessity for a propitiatory victim, are modes of action which, ascribed to a
human ruler, would call forth expressions of abhorrence.”</p>

<div class='c020'>(“<cite>Religion: a Retrospect and a Prospect.</cite>”)</div>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Your Grace will say, no doubt, that Jesus never taught the worship of
such a god as that. Even so say we Theosophists. Yet that is the very
god whose worship is officially conducted in Canterbury Cathedral, by
you, my Lord Primate of England; and your Grace will surely agree
with us that there must indeed be a divine spark of religious intuition in
the hearts of men, that enables them to resist so well as they do, the
deadly action of such poisonous theology.</p>

<p class='c028'>If your Grace, from your high pinnacle, will cast your eyes around,
you will behold a Christian civilisation in which a frantic and merciless
battle of man against man is not only the distinguishing feature, but the
acknowledged principle. It is an accepted scientific and economic axiom
to-day, that all progress is achieved through the struggle for existence
and the survival of the fittest; and the fittest to survive in this Christian
civilization are not those who are possessed of the qualities that are
recognised by the morality of every age to be the best—not the generous,
the pious, the noble-hearted, the forgiving, the humble, the truthful, the
honest, and the kind—but those who are strongest in selfishness, in
craft, in hypocrisy, in brute force, in false pretence, in unscrupulousness,
in cruelty, and in avarice. The spiritual and the altruistic are “the
weak,” whom the “laws” that govern the universe give as food to the
egoistic and material—“the strong.” That “might is right” is the only
legitimate conclusion, the last word of the 19th century ethics, for, as the
world has become one huge battlefield, on which “the fittest” descend
like vultures to tear out the eyes and the hearts of those who have fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in the fight. Does religion put a stop to the battle? Do the churches
drive away the vultures, or comfort the wounded and the dying? Religion
does not weigh a feather in the <em>world</em> at large to-day, when worldly
advantage and selfish pleasures are put in the other scale; and the
churches are powerless to revivify the religious sentiment among men,
because their ideas, their knowledge, their methods, and their arguments
are those of the Dark Ages. My Lord Primate, your Christianity is
five hundred years behind the times.</p>

<p class='c028'>So long as men disputed whether this god or that god was the true
one, or whether the soul went to this place or that one after death, you,
the clergy, understood the question, and had arguments at hand to
influence opinion—by syllogism or torture, as the case might require; but
now it is the existence of any such being as God, at all, or of any kind
of immortal spirit, that is questioned or denied. Science invents new
theories of the Universe which contemptuously ignore the existence of
any god; moralists establish theories of ethics and social life in which
the non-existence of a future life is taken for granted; in physics, in
psychology, in law, in medicine, the one thing needful in order to entitle
any teacher to a hearing is that no reference whatever should be contained
in his ideas either to a Providence, or to a soul. The world is
being rapidly brought to the conviction that god is a mythical conception,
which has no foundation in fact, or place in Nature; and that the immortal
part of man is the silly dream of ignorant savages, perpetuated
by the lies and tricks of priests, who reap a harvest by cultivating the
fears of men that their mythical God will torture their imaginary souls
to all eternity, in a fabulous Hell. In the face of all these things the clergy
stand in this age dumb and powerless. The only answer which the
Church knew how to make to such “objections” as these, were <em>the rack
and the faggot</em>; and she cannot use that system of logic <em>now</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is plain that if the God and the soul taught by the churches be
imaginary entities, then the Christian salvation and damnation are mere
delusions of the mind, produced by the hypnotic process of assertion and
suggestion on a magnificent scale, acting cumulatively on generations of
mild “hysteriacs.” What answer have you to such a theory of the
Christian religion, except a repetition of assertions and suggestions?
What ways have you of bringing men back to their old beliefs but by
reviving their old habits? “Build more churches, say more prayers,
establish more missions, and your faith in damnation and salvation will
be revived, and a renewed belief in God and the soul will be the necessary
result.” That is the policy of the churches, and their only answer to
agnosticism and materialism. But your Grace must know that to meet
the attacks of modern science and criticism with such weapons as
assertion and habit, is like going forth against magazine guns, armed with
boomerangs and leather shields. While, however, the progress of ideas
and the increase of knowledge are undermining the popular theology, every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>discovery of science, every new conception of European advanced
thought, brings the 19th century mind nearer to the ideas of the Divine
and the Spiritual, known to all esoteric religions and to Theosophy.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Church claims that Christianity is the only true religion, and
this claim involves two distinct propositions, namely, that Christianity
is true religion, and that there is no true religion except Christianity.
It never seems to strike Christians that God and Spirit could possibly
exist in any other form than that under which they are presented in the
doctrines of their church. The savage calls the missionary an Atheist,
because he does not carry an idol in his trunk; and the missionary, in
his turn, calls everyone an Atheist who does not carry about a fetish in
his mind; and neither savage nor Christian ever seem to suspect that
there may be a higher idea than their own of the great hidden power
that governs the Universe, to which the name of “God” is much more
applicable. It is doubtful whether the churches take more pains to
prove Christianity “true,” or to prove that any other kind of religion
is necessarily “false;” and the evil consequences of this, their teaching,
are terrible. When people discard dogma they fancy that they have
discarded the religious sentiment also, and they conclude that religion
is a superfluity in human life—a rendering to the clouds of things that
belong to earth, a waste of energy which could be more profitably expended
in the struggle for existence. The materialism of this age is,
therefore, the direct consequence of the Christian doctrine that there is
no ruling power in the Universe, and no immortal Spirit in man except
those made known in Christian dogmas. The Atheist, my Lord Primate,
is the bastard son of the Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>But this is not all. The churches have never taught men any other
or higher reason why they should be just and kind and true than the
hope of reward and the fear of punishment, and when they let go their
belief in Divine caprice and Divine injustice the foundations of their
morality are sapped. They have not even natural morality to consciously
fall back upon, for Christianity has taught them to regard it
as worthless on account of the natural depravity of man. Therefore
self-interest becomes the only motive for conduct, and the fear of being
found out, the only deterrent from vice. And so, with regard to morality
as well as to God and the soul, Christianity pushes men off the path that
leads to knowledge, and precipitates them into the abyss of incredulity,
pessimism and vice. The last place where men would now look for
help from the evils and miseries of life is the Church, because they know
that the building of churches and the repeating of litanies influence
neither the powers of Nature nor the councils of nations; because they
instinctively feel that when the churches accepted the principle of expediency
they lost their power to move the hearts of men, and can now
only act on the external plane, as the supporters of the policeman and
the politician.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>The function of religion is to comfort and encourage humanity in its
life-long struggle with sin and sorrow. This it can do only by presenting
mankind with noble ideals of a happier existence after death, and of
a worthier life on earth, to be won in both cases by conscious effort.
What the world now wants is a Church that will tell it of Deity, or
the immortal principle in man, which will be at least on a level with
the ideas and knowledge of the times. Dogmatic Christianity is not
suited for a world that reasons and thinks, and only those who can
throw themselves into a mediæval state of mind, can appreciate a Church
whose religious (as distinguished from its social and political) function
is to keep God in good humour while the laity are doing what they
believe he does not approve; to pray for changes of weather; and occasionally,
to thank the Almighty for helping to slaughter the enemy. It
is not “medicine men,” but spiritual guides that the world looks for to-day—a
“clergy” that will give it ideals as suited to the intellect of this
century, as the Christian Heaven and Hell, God and the Devil, were to
the ages of dark ignorance and superstition. Do, or can, the Christian
clergy fulfil this requirement? The misery, the crime, the vice, the
selfishness, the brutality, the lack of self-respect and self-control, that
mark our modern civilization, unite their voices in one tremendous cry,
and answer—<span class='fss'>NO!</span></p>

<p class='c028'>What is the meaning of the reaction against materialism, the signs of
which fill the air to-day? It means that the world has become mortally
sick of the dogmatism, the arrogance, the self-sufficiency, and the spiritual
blindness of modern science—of that same Modern Science which men
but yesterday hailed as their deliverer from religious bigotry and
Christian superstition, but which, like the Devil of the monkish legends,
requires, as the price of its services, the sacrifice of man’s immortal soul.
And meanwhile, what are the Churches doing? The Churches are
sleeping the sweet sleep of endowments, of social and political influence,
while the world, the flesh, and the devil, are appropriating their watchwords,
their miracles, their arguments, and their blind faith. The
Spiritualists—oh! Churches of Christ—have stolen the fire from your altars
to illumine their séance rooms; the Salvationists have taken your
sacramental wine, and make themselves spiritually drunk in the streets;
the Infidel has stolen the weapons with which you vanquished him
once, and triumphantly tells you that “What you advance, has been
frequently said before.” Had ever clergy so splendid an opportunity?
The grapes in the vineyard are ripe, needing only the right labourers to
gather them. Were you to give to the world some proof, on the level of the
present intellectual standard of probability, that Deity—the immortal
Spirit in man—have a real existence as facts in Nature, would not men hail
you as their saviour from pessimism and despair, from the maddening
and brutalizing thought that there is no other destiny for man but an
eternal blank, after a few short years of bitter toil and sorrow?—aye;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>as their saviours from the panic-stricken fight for material enjoyment
and worldly advancement, which is the direct consequence of believing
this mortal life to be the be-all and end-all of existence?</p>

<p class='c028'>But the Churches have neither the knowledge nor the faith needed to
save the world, and perhaps your Church, my Lord Primate, least of all,
with the mill-stone of £8,000,000 a year hung round its neck. In vain you
try to lighten the ship by casting overboard the ballast of doctrines
which your forefathers deemed vital to Christianity. What more can your
Church do now, than run before the gale with bare poles, while the
clergy feebly endeavour to putty up the gaping leaks with the “revised
version,” and by their social and political deadweight try to prevent the
ship from capsizing, and its cargo of dogmas and endowments from going
to the bottom?</p>

<p class='c028'>Who built Canterbury Cathedral, my Lord Primate? Who invented
and gave life to the great ecclesiastical organisation which makes an
Archbishop of Canterbury possible? Who laid the foundation of the
vast system of religious taxation which gives you £15,000 a year and a
palace? Who instituted the forms and ceremonies, the prayers and
litanies, which, slightly altered and stripped of art and ornament, make
the liturgy of the Church of England? Who wrested from the people
the proud titles of “reverend divine” and “Man of God” which the
clergy of your Church so confidently assume? Who, indeed, but the
Church of Rome! We speak in no spirit of enmity. Theosophy has
seen the rise and fall of many faiths, and will be present at the birth and
death of many more. We know that the lives of religions are subject to
law. Whether you inherited legitimately from the Church of Rome, or
obtained by violence, we leave you to settle with your enemies and
with your conscience; for our mental attitude towards your Church is
determined by its intrinsic worthiness. We know that if it be unable to
fulfil the true spiritual function of a religion, it will surely be swept
away, even though the fault lie rather in its hereditary tendencies, or in
its environments, than in itself.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Church of England, to use a homely simile, is like a train
running by the momentum it acquired before steam was shut off.
When it left the main track, it got upon a siding that leads nowhere.
The train has nearly come to a standstill, and many of the passengers
have left it for other conveyances. Those that remain are for the most
part aware that they have been depending all along upon what little
steam was left in the boiler when the fires of Rome were withdrawn
from under it. They suspect that they may be only playing at train
now; but the engineer keeps blowing his whistle and the guard goes
round to examine the tickets, and the breaksmen rattle their breaks, and
it is not such bad fun after all. For the carriages are warm and comfortable
and the day is cold, and so long as they are tipped all the company’s
servants are very obliging. But those who know where they want to go,
are not so contented.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>For several centuries the Church of England has performed the
difficult feat of blowing hot and cold in two directions at once—saying
to the Roman Catholics “Reason!” and to the Sceptics “Believe!”
It was by adjusting the force of its two-faced blowing, that it has
managed to keep itself so long from falling off the fence. But now the
fence itself is giving way. Disendowment and disestablishment are in
the air. And what does your Church urge in its own behalf? Its usefulness.
It is <em>useful</em> to have a number of educated, moral, unworldly men,
scattered all over the country, who prevent the world from utterly forgetting
the name of religion, and who act as centres of benevolent work. But
the question now is no longer one of repeating prayers, and giving alms to
the poor, as it was five hundred years ago. The people have come of age,
and have taken their thinking and the direction of their social, private and
even spiritual affairs into their own hands, for they have found out
that their clergy know no more about “things of Heaven” than
they do themselves.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the Church of England, it is said, has become so liberal that all
ought to support it. Truly, one can go to an excellent imitation of the
mass, or sit under a virtual Unitarian, and still be within its fold. This
beautiful tolerance, however, only means that the Church has found it
necessary to make itself an open common, where every one can put up
his own booth, and give his special performance if he will only join in
the defence of the endowments. Tolerance and liberality are contrary
to the laws of the existence of any church that believes in divine damnation,
and their appearance in the Church of England is not a sign of
renewed life, but of approaching disintegration. No less deceptive is the
energy evinced by the Church in the building of churches. If this were
a measure of religion what a pious age this would be! Never was
dogma so well housed before, though human beings may have to sleep
by thousands in the streets, and to literally starve in the shadow of
our majestic cathedrals, built in the name of Him who had not where to
lay His head. But did Jesus tell you, your Grace, that religion lay not
in the hearts of men, but in temples made with hands? You cannot
convert your piety into stone and use it in your lives; and history shows
that petrifaction of the religious sentiment is as deadly a disease as
ossification of the heart. Were churches, however, multiplied a hundred
fold, and were every clergyman to become a centre of philanthropy, it
would only be substituting the work that the poor require from their
fellow men but not from their spiritual teachers, for that which they ask
and cannot obtain. It would but bring into greater relief the spiritual
barrenness of the doctrines of the Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>The time is approaching when the clergy will be called upon to
render an account of their stewardship. Are you prepared, my Lord
Primate, to explain to <span class='fss'>YOUR MASTER</span> why you have given His children
stones, when they cried to you for bread? You smile in your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>fancied security. The servants have kept high carnival so long in the
inner chambers of the Lord’s house, that they think He will surely
never return. But He told you He would come as a thief in the night;
and lo! He is coming already in the hearts of men. He is coming to
take possession of His Father’s kingdom there, where alone His kingdom
is. But you know Him not! Were the Churches themselves not carried
away in the flood of negation and materialism which has engulfed
Society, they would recognise the quickly growing germ of the Christ-spirit
in the hearts of thousands, whom they now brand as infidels and
madmen. They would recognise there the same spirit of love, of self-sacrifice,
of immense pity for the ignorance, the folly, and the sufferings
of the world, which appeared in its purity in the heart of Jesus, as
it had appeared in the hearts of other Holy Reformers in other ages;
and which is the light of all true religion, and the lamp by which the
Theosophists of all times have endeavoured to guide their steps along
the narrow path that leads to salvation—the path which is trodden by
every incarnation of <span class='sc'>Christos</span> or the <span class='sc'>Spirit of Truth</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>And now, my Lord Primate, we have very respectfully laid before you
the principal points of difference and disagreement between Theosophy
and the Christian Churches, and told you of the oneness
of Theosophy and the teachings of Jesus. You have heard our profession
of faith, and learned the grievances and plaints which we lay at the
door of dogmatic Christianity. We, a handful of humble individuals, possessed
of neither riches nor worldly influence, but strong in our knowledge,
have united in the hope of doing the work which you say that your
<span class='sc'>Master</span> has allotted to you, but which is so sadly neglected by that
wealthy and domineering colossus—the Christian Church. Will you
call this presumption, we wonder? Will you, in this land of free opinion,
free speech, and free effort, venture to accord us no other recognition than
the usual <em>anathema</em>, which the Church keeps in store for the reformer?
Or may we hope that the bitter lessons of experience, which that policy
has afforded the Churches in the past, will have altered the hearts and
cleared the understandings of her rulers; and that the coming year,
1888, will witness the stretching out to us of the hand of Christians in
fellowship and goodwill? This would only be a just recognition that
the comparatively small body called the Theosophical Society is no
pioneer of the Anti-Christ, no brood of the Evil one, but the practical
helper, perchance the saviour, of Christianity, and that it is only endeavouring
to do the work that Jesus, like Buddha, and the other
“sons of God” who preceded him, has commanded all his followers to
undertake, but which the Churches, having become dogmatic, are entirely
unable to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c028'>And now, if your Grace can prove that we do injustice to the Church
of which you are the Head, or to popular Theology, we promise to acknowledge
our error publicly. But—“<span class='sc'>Silence gives Consent.</span>”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>The sunset, to the boor a mere mass of evening vapours, presaging
rain for his fields or heat for his harvest, expands for the poet,
standing beside him and beholding the self-same firmament,
into a splendid picture, rich in crimson and purple, in golden light and
gleaming colour, mingled in harmonious purity.</p>

<p class='c028'>Whence so great a difference?</p>

<p class='c028'>The poet has finer eyes; and within the mere material forms perceives
a subtle essence, which flows everywhere through nature, adding to all it
touches a new wealth of joy and power. The poet’s eyes have opened to
a new reality; he no longer values things for themselves; but in proportion
as they contain this quality, they become dear to him.</p>

<p class='c028'>But beyond the poet, there is yet a third rank. The poet, it is true,
rejoices in nature, and perceives its beauty and symbolic character.
But he rests in the beauty of the symbol, and does not pass to the
reality symbolised. Rapt in adoration of the beauty of the garment,
he does not pierce through to Him who wears the garment. This
remains for the philosopher—the sage. Yet the boor has his place in
Nature. He has tilled and subdued the soil, has brought its latent
powers into action; in command of nature, he is far in advance of the
mere nomad savage, for whom nature is a maze of uncertain and unconquered
forces.</p>

<p class='c028'>The savage, the boor, the poet; these types have their parallels in
mental life.</p>

<p class='c028'>When the crude conceptions of nature, which mark dawning civilisation,
give place to those fair and truer, because more harmonious, views
which bear the name of Science; when the principle of Continuity, the
reign of Universal Law, have displaced the first notions of Chance and
Discord, the work of the physical scientist is done; he must stand aside,
and make way for the philosopher, the transcendentalist. Modern
Science has replaced the crudities of mediæval theology by the idea of
an orderly universe permeated by Law, binding alike the galaxy and
the atom, as the tillage of the farmer has replaced the nomadism of the
savage.</p>

<p class='c028'>But within the world of the boor nestles the poet’s world, and within
the world of the physical scientist lies an ethereal, spiritual universe, with
its own powers, its own prophets. The great trilogy of friends at the
beginning of this century, who rose like three mountain peaks above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>their contemporaries, Goethe, Carlyle, and Emerson, were chosen by
Destiny as prophets of this nature within nature.</p>

<p class='c028'>Their gleanings have been rich enough to tempt many to enter the
same field, though they have no more exhausted its wealth than Homer
and Shakespeare have exhausted poetry.</p>

<p class='c028'>The new world they have explored, is the land of hope of the future,
for which we must leave the impoverished soil of theology, and the arid
deserts of materialism.</p>

<p class='c028'>What these three masters taught, Occultism teaches; and we propose
to show them as great natural masters in the mystic knowledge.</p>

<p class='c028'>To do this with any completeness in the space at our disposal is
necessarily impossible; for the present, we must content ourselves with
shewing from the writings of one of the masters, Emerson, that he recognised
some of the chief laws announced by Occultism.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first truth to be insisted on, concerning this nature within nature,
the spiritual universe, is that it exists for its own ends, and not as an
adjunct to the material world; in other words, the end of morals is to
make archangels rather than good citizens.</p>

<p class='c028'>Spirit is the reality; matter, the secondary; or, as Goethe says, the
<em>Garment</em> of God.</p>

<p class='c028'>No occultist could insist on the subordinate character of matter more
vehemently than Emerson—he writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Nature is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the same. Through the
bruteness and toughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will.
The world proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man. It is a <em>remoter and
inferior incarnation of God</em>, a projection of God into the unconscious.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The Occultist sees in this world of spirit the home of that true joy of
which all earthly happiness is the shadow, and whispered intimation.
There all ideals find their realization, all highest hopes their fulfilment;
there flow abundant fountains of celestial bliss, whose least presence
makes earthly things radiant.</p>

<p class='c028'>Of spirit, Emerson writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“But when following the invisible steps of thought, we come to enquire, Whence
is matter? and where to? Many truths arise to us out of the recesses of consciousness.
We learn that the highest is present to the soul of man, that the dread universal
essence which is not wisdom, or love, or beauty, or power; but all in one, and each
entirely, is that for which all things exist, and that by which they are; that spirit
creates; that behind nature, throughout nature spirit is present. As a plant upon the
earth, so a man rests upon the bosom of God; he is nourished by unfailing fountains,
and draws, at his need, inexhaustible power.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>But to obtain a footing in this world of essential being, is to be
emancipated from the domination of Time and Space, to enter a universe
where they do not exist; for Space and Time are no realities, but, as
Carlyle says, the “deepest of all <em>illusory appearances</em>.” Emancipation
from Space and Time; how much more this implies than is at first sight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>apparent. The first fruit of this freedom is a feeling of eternalness, the
real basis of the doctrine of immortality. It is an attainable reality, this
sense of eternalness; let the sceptic and materialist say what they will.</p>

<p class='c028'>Of this truth, also, we may bring Emerson as witness. He writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“To truth, justice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of <em>immutableness</em> is
essentially associated. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no
question of continuance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Once recognise the truth that we can gain a footing in a world free
from the tyranny of time, that the soul exists in such a world, and a new
philosophy is at once required. Freedom from Time implies the eternity
of the soul, and the facts of life and death take a new position and
significance. If the soul be eternal, death must be an illusion, a garment
in which Nature wraps some hidden law.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the following words of Emerson, on this subject:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“It is the secret of the world that <em>all things subsist and do not die</em>, but only retire a
little from sight, and afterwards return again. Whatever does not concern us, is
concealed from us. As soon as a person is no longer related to our present well-being,
he is concealed or <em>dies</em>, as we say. When the man has exhausted for the time the nourishment
to be drawn from any one person or thing, that object is withdrawn from his
observation, and though still in his immediate neighbourhood, he does not suspect its
presence. Nothing is dead; men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals
and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and
well, in some new disguise. Jesus is not dead; he is very well alive; nor John, nor
Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>we have an accurate exposition of the occult doctrine of Reincarnation—the
progressive discipline of the soul through many lives—which has
been parodied in the popular fable of metemphsychosis.</p>

<p class='c028'>The true occult doctrine does not picture a series of bodies in each of
which the soul makes a temporary sojourn. In this, as in all else, it
begins with spirit and then descends to matter. It depicts that vital
energy which we call a soul, alternately exuding from itself and re-absorbing
into its own nature an environment or physical encasement,
whose character varies with the increasing stature of the soul.
According to the teaching of occultism, the successive formations of this
objective shell—whose purpose is to provide for the development of the
animal nature—alternate with periods of subjective life, which give
expansion to the powers of the soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>As corollary to this doctrine, occultism postulates a second—that the
incidents of each objective environment or physical life—are not fortuitous
and isolated, but that they are bound to all that precede and follow
them, and moreover that “the future is not arbitrarily formed by any
separate acts of the present, but that the whole future is in unbroken
continuity with the present, as the present is with the past.”</p>

<p class='c028'>To the various developments of this law, eastern philosophy has given
the name of Karma; the west has as yet no name for it. But though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>unnamed, its leading ideas have not been unperceived by those western
minds which have penetrated into the world of supernature.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus we find Emerson writing:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Every secret is told, every crime is punished, every virtue rewarded, every wrong
redressed, in silence and certainty. Crime and punishment grow on one stem;
punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of pleasure which concealed
it. You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. The thief steals from
himself; the swindler swindles himself. Everything in nature, even motes and
feathers, goes by law and not by luck. <em>What a man sows, he reaps.</em>”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The picture of an orderly universe, where matter is the garment of
spirit—spirit visualised—where souls march onward in orderly procession
to boundless perfection; where the life of each permeates and
flows through the life of all; where the wrong of each is turned to the
benefit of all by the firm hand of an invisible and ever active law,
incessantly disciplining and correcting, till the last dross of self and sin
is purged away, and instead of man there remains God only, working
through the powers that were man’s; such is the conception Occultism
holds.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I know not,” says Emerson—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“I know not whether there be, as is alleged, in the upper region of our atmosphere
a permanent westerly current, which carries with it all atoms which rise to that height,
but I see that when souls reach a certain clearness of perfection, they accept a knowledge
and motive above selfishness. A breath of Will blows eternally through the
universe of souls in the direction of the Right and Necessary. It is the air which
all intellects inhale and exhale, and it is the wind which blows the world into order
and orbit.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Let us build altars to the Beautiful Necessity which rudely or softly educates men
to the perception that there are no contingencies, that Law rules through existence,
a Law which is not intelligent but intelligence, not personal nor impersonal—it disdains
words, and passes understanding; it dissolves persons; it vivifies nature, yet
solicits the pure in heart to draw on its all, its omnipotence.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Discipline always and everywhere throughout the universe; to
discipline, development, all other facts are subordinate; for their sake,
all laws are enunciated, all spiritual facts are insisted on; all truths
which tend not to the melioration of human life—if any such there be—are
worthless. Discipline, development. What development does
Occultism predict for man? Man’s future destiny, in the view of
Occultism, is so stupendous, that we prefer merely to erect a finger-post
pointing out the direction of the path, using the words of Emerson:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The youth puts off the illusions of the child, the man puts off the ignorance and
tumultuous passions of the youth; proceeding thence, puts off the egotism of manhood,
and becomes at last a public and universal soul. He is rising to greater height, but
also to realities; the outer relations and circumstances dying out, he is entering
deeper into God, God into him, until the last garment of egotism falls, and he is with
God, shares the will and the immensity of the First Cause.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>From first to last, Occultism has preached no doctrine more
emphatically than the necessity of dependence on the intuitions, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>the reality of interior illumination. “Seek out the way by making the
profound obeisance of the soul to the dim star that burns within; within
you is the light of the world,” writes the Occultist.</p>

<p class='c028'>And this doctrine is repeated again and again in the writings of the
philosopher we have been quoting from. He writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across
his mind from within, more than the lustre of the <a id='corr256.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='firmanent'>firmament</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_256.7'><ins class='correction' title='firmanent'>firmament</ins></a></span> of bards and sages.
From within or from behind, a light shines through us upon things, and makes us
aware that we are nothing, but that the light is all. The consciousness in each man
is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the
flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees. There is for each a Best
Counsel, which enjoins the fit word and the fit act for every moment. There is no bar
or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The
walls are taken away, we lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the
attributes of God. The simplest person who, in his integrity, worships God, becomes
God; yet for ever and ever the influx of this better and universal self is new and
unsearchable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The life of one is the life of all. The good of one re-acts on all. The
walls by which selfishness conceives itself enclosed and isolated, are
unreal, have no existence. Spirit is fluid and all-pervading; its
beneficent power flows unchecked from soul to soul, energising, harmonising,
purifying. To resist all discordant tendencies which check
this salutary flow, this all-permeating love, is to come under the reign
of Universal Brotherhood; and to the honour of Occultism be it said,
that Universal Brotherhood is blazoned highest on its standard.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Thus,” writes Emerson—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>—“Are we put in training for a love which knows not sex nor person, nor partiality,
but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere. One day all men will be
lovers, and every calamity will be dissolved in universal sunshine. An acceptance of
the sentiment of love throughout Christendom for a season would bring the felon and
the outcast to our side in tears, with the devotion of his faculties to our service.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>But to the axiom “Kill out the sense of separateness” Occultism adds
another, “Yet stand alone.” Before the lesson of life can be learnt, the
soul must in some sort detach itself from its environment, and view all
things impersonally, in solitude and stillness. There is an oracle in the
lonely recess of the soul to which all things must be brought for trial.
Here all laws are tested, all appearances weighed.</p>

<p class='c028'>About this truth always hangs a certain solemnity, and Emerson has
given it a fitting expression in the following words:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The soul gives itself alone, original, and pure, to the Lonely, Original, and Pure, who,
on that condition, gladly inhabits, leads, and speaks through it. Then it is glad, young,
and nimble. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great, the universal mind. I, the
imperfect, adore my own Perfect. I am somehow receptive of the great soul, and
thereby I do overlook the sun and the stars, and feel them to be the fair accidents and
effects which change and pass. More and more the surges of everlasting nature enter
into me, and I become public and human in my regards and actions. So I come to
live in thoughts, and act with energies, which are immortal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The last words of this sentence lead us to the occult idea of <em>Mahatma-hood</em>,
which conceives a perfected soul as “living in thoughts, and acting
with energies which are immortal.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The <em>Mahatma</em> is a soul of higher rank in the realms of life, conceived
to drink in the wealth of spiritual power closer to the fountain-head, and
to distil its essence into the interior of receptive souls.</p>

<p class='c028'>In harmony with this idea, Emerson writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Truth is the summit of being; justice is the application of it to affairs. All
individual natures stand in a scale, according to the purity of this element in them.
The will of the pure runs down from them into other natures, as water runs down from
a higher into a lower vessel; this natural force is no more to be withstood than any
other natural force. A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True, as the
magnet arranges itself with the pole, so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent
object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso journeys towards the sun, journeys
towards that person.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Occultism conceives the outer world and all its accidents to be so
many veils, shrouding the splendour of essential nature, and tempering
the fiery purity of spirit to the imperfect powers of the understanding
soul. This illusory power Occultism considers to be the “active will of
God,” a means to the ends of eternal spirit.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the view of Occultism, life is a drama of thinly veiled souls; as
Shakespeare writes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“We are such stuff</div>
      <div class='line'>As dreams are made of, and our little life</div>
      <div class='line'>Is rounded with a sleep!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c035'>We shall conclude with two passages from Emerson’s essays, on the
subject of illusions:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail? If you could look with
her eyes, you might see her surrounded with hundreds of figures performing complex
dramas, with tragic and comic issues, long conversations, many characters, many ups
and downs of fate; and meantime it is only puss and her tail. How long before our
masquerade will end its noise of tambourines, laughter, and shouting, and we shall
find it was a solitary performance?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>We must supplement this rather playful passage with one in a higher
strain:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“There is no chance, and no anarchy, in the universe. All is system and gradation.
Every god is there sitting in his sphere. The young mortal enters the hall of the
firmament; there is he alone with them alone, they pouring on him benedictions and
gifts, and beckoning him up to their thrones. On an instant, and incessantly, fall
snowstorms and illusions. He fancies himself in a vast crowd which sways this way
and that, and whose movement and doings he must obey: he fancies himself poor,
orphaned, insignificant. The mad crowd drives hither and thither, now furiously
commanding this thing to be done, now that. What is he that he should resist their
will, and think or act for himself? Every moment new changes and new showers of
deceptions to baffle and distract him. And when, by-and-bye, for an instant, the air
clears, and the cloud lifts a little, there are the gods still sitting around him on their
thrones—they alone with him alone.”</p>

<p class='c028'>[<em>Some of the readers of</em> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> <em>have taken great exception to the love passages
between Fleta and Hilary, saying that they are not up to the standard of Theosophic
thought, and are out of place in the magazine. The author can only beg that time may
be given for the story to develope. None of us that is born dies without experiencing
human passion; it is the base on which an edifice must rise at last, after many incarnations
have purified it; “it is the blossom which has in it the fruit.” Hilary is still
only a man, he has not yet learned to the full the lesson of human life and human passion.
Fleta promises him all that he can take and that plainly is only what she can
give—the deep love of the disciple. But she cannot instantly free his eyes from the
illusions caused by his own passionate heart; till he has suffered and conquered, he
cannot recognise her for what she is, the pledged servant of a great master, of necessity
more white-souled than any nun need be.</em></p>

<p class='c028'><em>Another strange criticism is made, condemning portions of the story as though expressive
of the author’s feelings and sentiments; whereas they are simply descriptive of the
states through which Hilary is passing. They no more express the author’s feelings
than do those later parts which refer to the ordeals of Fleta, the accepted disciple, express
the author’s feelings. The two characters of the struggling aspirant and the advanced
disciple, are studies from life. The stumbling-block of human passion which stands in
Hilary’s way, is the same which lost Zanoni his high estate; in the coming chapters
of “The Blossom and the Fruit,” we shall see Fleta flung back from the high estate she
aims at, by this same stumbling-block, in an idealised and subtle form. She has not
yet learned the bitter truth that the Occultist must stand absolutely alone, without
even companionship of thought, or sympathy of feeling, at the times of the Initiations
and the trials which precede them.</em>—M. C.]</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER VI.—(<i>Continued.</i>)</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>Hilary found himself in a room which no longer permitted him
to regret his own rooms at home, for it was more luxurious. A
great bath stood ready filled with perfumed water, and he
hastened to bathe himself therein, with a sort of idea that he was perhaps
suffering from hallucinations, some of which he might wash away.
His scanty luggage had been brought into the room, and when the bath
was over Hilary got out a velvet suit which he thought would do well
for evening-dress in this palace of surprises. He was but just ready
when a knock came at his door, and without further ceremony, Mark
opened it and looked in.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“Come,” he said, “we don’t wait for anybody here. The cook won’t
stand it. He is a very holy father indeed, and nobody dare say him
nay, unless it were the Princess herself. She always does as she likes.
Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Quite,” replied Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>Opening out of the entrance was a great oak door, double, and very
richly carved. This had been shut when Hilary passed through before;
now it stood open, and Mark led the way through it. They entered an
immense room, of which the floor was polished so that it shone like a
mirror. Two figures were standing in the midst of this room, dressed
alike in clouds of white lace; they were the two Fletas, as to Hilary’s
eyes they still seemed.</p>

<p class='c028'>His heart was torn as he gazed on them, waiting for a glance
of love, a gleam of love-light, to tell him which was his own, his
Fleta, his princess, the Fleta whom he served. There was none; they
had been talking together very earnestly and both looked sad and a
little weary.</p>

<p class='c028'>As Hilary’s eyes wandered from one face to the other his mind
grew confused. And then suddenly a flash of bewitchingly beautiful
laughter came on one of the faces; and immediately he decided that
must be Adine. And yet, had he not seen just such laughter flash across
Fleta’s face? But all this passed in a moment, and no more time was
given him for thought. A table stood at one end of the hall, set as a
king’s table might be; covered with the finest linen, edged with deep
lace, and with gold dishes of fruit upon it; it was decorated with lovely
flowers. Hilary opened his eyes a little even in the midst of his other much
greater perplexities, to see this luxury here in the midst of the forest. And
was it prepared in honour of Fleta, who ate a crust of dry bread in an ale-house
with perfect cheerfulness, or rather, indifference? Fleta took her
place at the end of the table; at least, one sister did so, and the other took
her place beside Hilary—he could not yet determine which was which, and
his whole soul was absorbed in the attempted solution of that problem.
Mark sat at the other end of the table, evidently prepared to do such
labours of carving as might be necessary. Two places were set at the
other side of the table, but no one came to fill them. A very elaborate
dinner was served, and a very good one; and Hilary thought he was
satisfied now that it was Adine who sat next him, for she showed
herself an unmistakable little gourmand. He had just come to this
conclusion when his attention was distracted by the great doors being
thrown open again for two persons to enter. Everyone rose, even Fleta,
who advanced with a smile to meet these new comers. Hilary rose also
and turned from the table. Two men stood there; one a man but
little older than himself, and of extremely fine appearance. Little more
than a boy, yet he had a dignity which made him something much
more, and Hilary felt immediately a kind of jealousy, undefined, vague,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>but still jealousy. For Fleta had put both her hands into those of this
handsome young man and greeted him with great warmth. At his side
stood a small shrivelled old man, in the same dress that Father Amyot
always wore. This circumstance again made Hilary wonder what had
become of Father Amyot; but he concluded Adine’s account had been the
correct one.</p>

<p class='c028'>There was something familiar in the face of the young man, so Hilary
thought; while he was thinking this, Fleta turned and introduced them
to each other.</p>

<p class='c028'>He was the young king to whom Fleta was betrothed.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is a history of those things which lie behind the scenes, not a
history of that which is known to all the world. We will give this young
King the name of Alan. Let those who like fix upon his kingdom and
assign to him his true name.</p>

<p class='c028'>He sat down opposite Hilary; and the old priest took his place
beside him. Hilary returned to his chair, feeling that all strength, and
hope, and power, and life had gone from him. By a fierce and terrible
revulsion of his whole nature and all his recent feelings, he returned to
his cynical estimate of mankind and most of all of Fleta. She had
brought him to this place simply to taunt and harass him and show him
his madness and folly in aspiring to her love in the face of such a rival.
It cut Hilary’s heart like a knife to find the young King so magnificent
a creature. And Fleta, why had she come here to meet him?
Why had she brought her unhappy lover with her? Hilary tore himself
with doubts, and fears, and questions; and sat silent, not even noticing
the plates that were placed before him and taken away untouched. The
others talked and laughed gaily, Alan being apparently possessed of a
hundred things to say. Hilary did not hear what they were, but it
annoyed him to find his rival speaking so much in that rich, musical
voice of his, while he himself sat dumb, silenced by a bitter pain that
tore his heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are sad,” said a soft voice at his side, “it is hard, if you love
Fleta, to see her monopolised by some one else. How often have I had
to suffer it? Well, it must be so, I suppose. Why am I sorry for you.
I wonder? For if Alan were not here you would monopolise Fleta, and
have no eyes for anyone else. Ah me!”</p>

<p class='c028'>The sigh was very tender, the voice very low and soft; and that voice
was Fleta’s voice, those lovely eyes uplifted to his were Fleta’s <a id='corr260.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eyes'>eyes.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_260.38'><ins class='correction' title='eyes'>eyes.</ins></a></span>
Yes, it was so! He thought as he looked back. Did he not know Fleta
well enough by now?</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah, you are playing with me,” he exclaimed eagerly, “it is Fleta
now, not Adine! Is it not so? Oh, my love, my love, be honest and
tell me!”</p>

<p class='c028'>He spoke like this under cover of the others’ voices, but Fleta looked
round alarmed.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“Hush!” she said, “take care. Your life would be lost if you
revealed our secret here. After dinner is over, come with me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This appointment made Hilary happy again; his heart leaped up, his
pulses throbbed; all the world changed. He found some fruit was
before him, he began to eat it, and to drink the wine in his glass. Fleta
was watching him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have just begun to dine!” said Fleta with a soft laugh. “Well,
never mind; you are young and strong. Do you think you could live
through a great many hardships?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary made the lover’s answer, which is so evident that it need not
be recorded. He did not know how he said it, but he desired to tell her
that for her he would endure anything. She laughed again.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It may be so!” she said thoughtfully; and then he caught her eyes
fixed upon him with a searching glance that for an instant seemed to
turn the blood cold in his veins. His terrible thoughts and doubts of
her returned again the more fiercely for their momentary repulsion. He
emptied his glass, but <a id='corr261.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>eat</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_261.17'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>eat</ins></a></span> nothing more, and was very glad when they
all rose from the table together, a few moments later. He followed the
figure of the girl who had sat next him since Alan’s entrance, believing
that Fleta had then changed her place. She went across the great room
and led the way into a greenhouse which opened out of it. A very
wonderful greenhouse it was, full of the strangest plants. They were
extremely beautiful, and yet in some way they inspired in him a great
repugnance. They were of many colours, and the blossoms were
variously shaped, but evidently they were all of one species.</p>

<p class='c028'>“These are very precious,” said Fleta, looking at the flowers near her
tenderly. “I obtain a rare and valuable substance from them. You
have seen me use it,” she added, after a moment’s pause. Hilary
longed to leave the greenhouse and sit elsewhere; but that was so
evidently not Fleta’s wish that he could not suggest it. There were
seats here and there among the flowers, and she placed herself upon one
of them, motioning Hilary to sit beside her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now,” she said, “I am going to tell you a great many things which
you have earned the right to know. To begin with, you are now in a
monastery, belonging to the most rigid of the religious orders.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Are you a Catholic?” asked Hilary suddenly. And then laughed at
himself for such a question. How could Fleta be catalogued like this?
He knew her to be a creature whose thought could not be limited.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she answered simply. “I am not a Catholic. But I belong to
this order. I fear such an answer will be so unintelligible as to be like
an impertinence. Forgive me, Hilary.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Ah, what a tone she spoke in, gentle, sweet—the voice of the woman
he loved. Hilary lost all control over himself. He sprang to his feet
and stood before her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I do not want to know your religion,” he exclaimed passionately, “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>do not want to know where we are, or why we are here. I ask you only
this—Are you indeed my love given to me, as you said this morning?—or
is your love given to the king, and are you only laughing at me. It
is enough to make me think so, to bring me here to meet him! Oh, it
is a cruel insult, a cruel mockery! For, Fleta, you have made me love
you with all my heart and soul. My whole life is yours. Be honest
and tell me the truth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have a powerful rival,” said Fleta deliberately. “Is he not
handsome, courtly, all that a king should be? And I am pledged to
him. Yes, Hilary, I am pledged to him. Would you have the woman
you love live a lie for your sake, and hourly betray the man she
marries?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I would have her give me her love,” said Hilary despairingly, “at all
costs, at all hazards. Oh, Fleta, do not keep me in agony. You said
this morning that you loved me, that you would give yourself to me. Are
you going to take those words back?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” said Fleta, “I am not. For I do love you, Hilary. Did I not
see you first in my sleep? Did I not dream of you? Did I not come
to your house in search of you? Unwomanly, was it not? No one
but Fleta would have done it. And Fleta would only have done it for
love. You do not know what she risked—what she risks now—for you!
Oh, Hilary, if you could guess what I have at stake. Never mind.
None can know my own danger but myself.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Escape from it!” said Hilary in a sort of madness. A passionate
desire to help her came over him and swept all reasonable thoughts
away. “You are so powerful, so free, there is no need for you to encounter
danger. Does it lie in these people, in this strange place? Come
back then to the city, to your home. What is there to induce you to
run risks, you that have all that the world can offer? Is there anything
you need that you cannot have?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” said Fleta, “there is. I need something which no power
of royalty can give me. I need something which I may have to
sacrifice my life to obtain. Yet I am ready to sacrifice it—oh, how
ready! What is my life to me! What is my life to me! Nothing!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She had risen and was impatiently walking to and fro, moving her
hands with a strange eager gesture as she did so; and her eyes were all
aflame. This was the woman he loved. This, who said her life was
nothing to her. Hilary forgot all else that was strange in her words
and manner in the thought of this. Could she then return his love—no,
it was impossible, if she meant these strange and terrible words that she
uttered!</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah, this it is that keeps me back,” she said, before he had time to
speak. Her voice had altered, and her face had grown pale, so pale that
he forgot everything else in watching her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This it is that keeps me from my strength, this longing for it!” And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>with a heavy sigh she moved back to her seat and fell into it with a
weariness he had never seen in her before. Her head drooped on her
breast, she fell into profound thought. Presently she spoke again, disjointedly,
and in such words as seemed unintelligible.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have always been too impatient, too eager,” she said sadly, “I
have always tried to take what I longed for without waiting to earn it.
So it was long ago, Hilary, when you and I stood beneath those blossoming
trees, long ages ago. I broke the peace that kept us strong and
simple. I caused the torment of pain and peril to arise in our lives.
We have to live it out—alas, Hilary, we have to live it out!—and live
beyond it. How long will it take us—how long will it take!”</p>

<p class='c028'>There was a despair, an agony in her voice and manner, that were so
new, he was bewildered, he hardly recognised her. Her moods changed
so strangely that he could not follow them, for he had not the key; he
could not read her thought. He sat dumb, looking in her sad drawn
face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My love, my love,” he murmured at last, hardly knowing that he
spoke, hardly knowing what his thought was that he spoke, only full of
longing. “Would that I could help you! Would that I understood
you!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you indeed wish to?” asked Fleta, her voice melting into a sort
of tender eagerness.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you not know it?” exclaimed Hilary. “My soul is burning to meet
yours and to recognise it, to stand with you and help you. Why are
you so far off, so like a star, so removed and unintelligible to me, who
love you so! Oh, help me to change this, to come nearer to you!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta rose slowly, her eyes fixed upon his face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” she said. And she held out her hand to him. He put his
into it, and together, hand in hand, they left the conservatory. They did
not enter the great dining hall, where now there was music and dancing
as Hilary could see and hear. They left the house of the strange
flowers by a different doorway, which admitted them to a long dim
corridor. Fleta opened the door by a key that was attached to a chain
hanging from her waist; and she closed it behind her. Hilary asked
no questions, for she seemed buried in thought so profound that he did
not care to rouse her.</p>

<p class='c028'>At the end of the corridor was a small and very low doorway. Fleta
stooped and knocked, and without waiting for any answer pushed the
door <a id='corr263.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='open,'>open.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_263.39'><ins class='correction' title='open,'>open.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>“May I come in, Master?” she said.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come, child,” was the answer, in a very gentle voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am bringing some one with me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” was repeated.</p>

<p class='c028'>They entered. The room was small, and was dimly lit by a shaded
lamp. Beside the table, on which this stood, sat a man, reading. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>put a large book which he had been holding, on to the table, and turned
towards his visitors. Hilary saw before him the handsomest man he had
ever seen in his life. He was still young, though Hilary felt himself to
be a boy beside him; he rose from his chair and stood before them very
tall and very slight, and yet there was that in his build which suggested
great strength. He looked attentively at Hilary for a moment, and then
turned to Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Leave him here.” Fleta bowed and immediately went out of
the room without another word. Hilary gazed upon her in amazement.
Was this the proud, imperious princess who yielded such instant
and ready obedience? It seemed incredible. But he forgot the extraordinary
sight immediately afterwards in the interest excited by his new
companion, who at once addressed him:</p>

<p class='c028'>“The Princess has often spoken to me of you,” he said, “and I know
she has much wished that this moment should arrive. She will be
satisfied if she thinks you appreciate with your inner senses the step you
are about to take if you accord with her wishes. But I think it right
you should know it in every aspect as far as that is possible. If you
really desire to know Fleta, to approach her, to understand her, you must
give up all that men ordinarily value in the world.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have it not to surrender,” said Hilary rather bitterly, “my life is
nothing splendid.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, but you are only at the beginning of it. To you the future is
full of promise. If you desire to be the Princess Fleta’s companion,
your life is no longer your own.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No—it is hers—and it is hers now!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Not so. It is not hers now, nor will it be hers then. Not even
your love does she claim for her own. She has nothing.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I don’t understand,” said Hilary simply. “She is the Princess of
this country; she will soon be the Queen of another. She has all that
the world has to give a woman.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you not know the woman you love better than to suppose that
she cares for her position in the world?” demanded this man whom
Fleta called her master. “At a word from me, at any hour, at any time
she will leave her throne and never return to it. That she will do this
certainly some day I know very well; and her sister will take her place,
the world being no wiser than it now is. Fleta looks forward to this
change eagerly.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Well, perhaps,” admitted Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Neither has she your love nor your life as her own. In loving her
you love the Great Order to which she belongs, and she will gladly give
your love to its right owner. She has done this already in bringing you
to me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary started to his feet, stung beyond endurance.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This is mere nonsense, mere insult,” he said angrily, “Fleta has
accepted my love with her own lips.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“That is so,” was the answer, “and she is betrothed to King Alan.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I know that,” said Hilary in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And what did you hold Fleta to be then? A mere pleasure seeker,
playing with life like the rest, devoid of honour and principle? Was
this your estimate of the woman you loved? What else indeed could it
be, when you said, let her give her hand to King Alan while you know
her love is yours! And you could love such a woman! Hilary Estanol,
you have been reared in a different school than this. Does not your own
conscience shame you?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary stood silent. Every word struck home. He knew not what to
say. He had been wilfully blinding himself; the bandages were rudely
drawn aside. After a long pause he spoke, hesitatingly:</p>

<p class='c028'>“The Princess cannot be judged as other women would be; she is
unlike all others.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Not so, if she is what you seem to think her; then she is just like the
rest, one of the common herd.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How can you speak of her in that way?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How can you think of her as you do, dishonouring her by your
thoughts?”</p>

<p class='c028'>The two stood opposite each other now, and their eyes met. A
strange light seemed to struggle into Hilary’s soul as these bitter words
rang sharply on his ear. Dishonouring her? Was it possible? He
staggered back and leaned against the wall, still gazing on the
magnificent face before him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Who are you?” he said at last.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am Father Ivan, the superior of the order to which the
Princess Fleta belongs,” was the reply. But another voice spoke
when his ceased, and Hilary saw that Fleta had entered, and was
standing behind him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And he is the master of knowledge, the master in life, the master in
thought, of whom the Princess Fleta is but a poor and impatient disciple.
Master, forgive me! I cannot endure to hear you speak as if you were a
monk, the mere tool of a religion, the mere professor of a miserable
creed.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She sank on her knees before Father Ivan, in an attitude strangely
full of humility. The priest bent down and lifted her to her feet. They
stood a moment in silence, side by side, Fleta’s eyes upon his face
devouring his expression with a passionate and adoring <a id='corr265.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='eagerness'>eagerness.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_265.38'><ins class='correction' title='eagerness'>eagerness.</ins></a></span>
How splendid they looked! Suddenly Hilary saw it, and a
wild, fierce, all-devouring flame of jealousy awoke in his heart—a
jealousy such as King Alan, no, nor a hundred King Alans, could
not have roused in him.</p>

<p class='c028'>For he saw that this Ivan, who wore a priest’s dress, yet was evidently
no priest, who spoke as if this world had no longer any meaning for him,
yet who was magnificent in his personal presence and power—he saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>that this man was Fleta’s equal. And more, he saw that Fleta’s whole
face melted and softened, and grew strangely sweet, as she looked on
him. Never had Hilary seen it like that. Never had Hilary dreamed
it could look like that. Stumbling like a blind man he felt for the door,
which he knew was near, and escaped from the room—how he knew not.
Hurriedly he went on, through places he did not see, and at last found
himself in the open air. He went with great strides away through the
tall ferns and undergrowth until he found himself in so quiet a spot that
it appeared as if he were alone in the great forest. Then he flung
himself upon the ground and yielded to an agony of despair which
blotted out sky and trees and everything from his gaze, like a great
cloud covering the earth.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>THE SPIRIT OF HEALING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>It is somewhat difficult to say what real or theosophical work is
when exactly defined, and, in consequence, it becomes very easy
to speak of an effort as untheosophical—that is not sufficiently
unselfish in motive. The fact is that the word Theosophy has such a
very wide meaning, embracing, as it does, the true spirit of all creeds
and religions, and confining itself to none in particular, that no work
done in the spirit of truth and wisdom is really untheosophical. Hence,
unless the speaker is possessed of more knowledge than ordinary men
concerning the causes which underlie our actions, the application of the
word untheosophical is incorrect. In fact, if it is once granted that it is
possible to work from an impersonal standpoint in favour of a particular
creed or religion, that work becomes theosophical in character. Thus
it is only work (in the widest sense of the word and on all planes)
from the personal standpoint, and which, therefore, militates against
Universal Brotherhood, which can really be described as untheosophical.
But this by no means presupposes that work which has outwardly the
appearance of theosophical genuineness is not really selfish. It is, of
course, the old story of the wolf in sheep’s clothing. We do but need
one example—the truly-called <em>profession</em> of Medicine. We constantly
hear of the wonderful self-sacrifice of medical men; of men who die at
their posts rather than desert a possible case in times of epidemic and
cholera; of men who suck tracheotomy tubes with almost certain death
by diphtheria staring them in the face; finally we hear, though but
seldom, of the honest, earnest devotion of a lifetime in places and districts
where the fees are so small that it is barely possible for the doctor to
live on his earnings. These are the heroes of the profession. Their
work, for the most part, consists of an unselfish devotion to the alleviation
of suffering, culminating in a final sacrifice of their personal selves—for
death is nothing less than this. But we must turn to the less favourable
side of the picture—the struggle not for a living, but for wealth, and
work, fired by ambition and the search for fame. Of course, apart
from the personal, selfish element in it, the ambitious struggle in other
professions than those of the Church or Medicine is of no great or unnatural
harm; but in these two cases it is more than harmful, it is a
degrading betrayal of trust. It is Simonism with a vengeance;
yes, kind friends, it approaches very nearly to the case of Judas,
who held the bag, and betrayed his Master with a kiss. It may
be asked why this sweeping denunciation is made of the two
noblest professions; of those two which, considered from the ethical
standpoint, consist of devotion to the service of man? The reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>is not very far to seek. The power which true healers possess—healers
alike of body and soul, is not one which can be sold for money or
bartered for wealth and fame. At least, if the possibility does exist,
it bears a suspicious resemblance to the old idea of selling one’s soul to
the devil in exchange for power and prosperity. It may be replied to
this that there is no harm in bartering knowledge of drugs, of pathology,
diagnosis of disease, surgical skill, etc.—in short, all the knowledge
acquired by education—for money. I answer No! for it is material
given for material, and nothing more. But these are not the sole
properties of the true healer, and those who do not possess these other
properties I speak of are not healers, and while they may <em>profess</em>
medicine<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c013'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and may be <em>in</em> it, are yet not <em>of</em> it.</p>

<p class='c028'>As regards the Church and its professors of religion, the case is even
worse; they have no material products of education to barter, and for the
most part are contented with telling their flock to “do as I bid you, and not
as I do.” But among them there are noble examples of unswerving unselfishness
and devotion, although for the most part those who enter the
Church are too young to understand fully the nature of their high calling.
Unfortunately the call in too many cases is not a call to minister and
heal souls, but to make a living and heal the souls in the process. But
again, it may be asked, what are these wonderful powers which constitute
the true healer, and which are not to be bought or sold? The first one
which occurs naturally to the mind is the power of sympathy. The old
joke in <cite>Punch</cite> about “the good bedside manner” has a considerable
substratum of truth when divested of its unpleasing folly. The substratum
of that manner is that which is given by sympathy; and this is
one of the first elements which constitute the power of healing. It gives
the power of suffering with the patient and therefore of understanding what
the sufferer is enduring. It is beyond diagnosis, although it assists it by
being much surer—at least, as to the reality of the suffering. But this
power of sympathy only expresses a part of the meaning of the power to
heal. Sympathy tends to annihilate the personal distinctions between
the healer and the sufferer; it tends to exalt the consciousness of the
healer not only to know the remedy for the disease, but to be himself
the power of cure, and also it is a vast occult power in virtue of which
all the “elder brethren” of the Universal Brotherhood live their lives;
in virtue of which the world’s great enlighteners have not only lived
their lives but <em>lived their death</em>, in order that they might benefit the
sufferers who despised and rejected them. But this power of sympathy
and the kindred powers which constitute the true healer, are really secret
powers and secret remedies. Therefore they are openly tabooed by the
medical profession, although the said professors cannot avoid using them.
But secret remedies are to some degree justly avoided. For it is but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>natural to regard secret remedies with suspicion. At best their use seems
like working in the dark and blindly, and, consequently, any results
obtained must be empirical. Again, the medical profession seems to plume
and feather itself upon possessing a slight leaven of its ideal condition,
and, by constituting itself into a kind of trades’ union, declines as a body
to have anything to do with any remedy of which the composition is
not made fully known. This, at least, is the more charitable view, for,
on the other hand, the doctors know only too well how eagerly the
public rushes after any new “quack” medicine, and seeks to cure itself
without calling in their aid. The doctors reply to this that they will
have nothing to do with a medicine whose composition is a secret, and
which is therefore devoted, to a great extent, to replenishing the purse of
its discoverer, and not to the cure of diseases from a love of man and a
hatred of suffering. This is a very high-sounding idea, and a noble one,
when it is not what the Americans would call only “high-falutin.” But
even when a remedy is made public property, it is not necessarily <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pro
bono publico</i></span>; in fact, as a rule, it serves only the good of the dispensing
chemist. He sees the prescription and notes it, the public does not; and,
as a rule, the chemist obtains the drugs cheaply, and compounds them at
the same rate as this medicine was originally sold under the patent of
its discoverer. Still, with all the dislike of the profession for secret
remedies, there is no doubt at all that in the case of the heads of the profession
some of the best results are obtained by the use of prescriptions,
which practically constitute a secret formula. The especial combination
which the particular man has discovered to be of use is his property, and
his only until he writes a book, for the various chemists who make it
up, and the various patients who drink it, are not to the full aware of its
value and use. The difference between this and quack medicine lies
merely in the peculiar names and large advertisements, but very often
these are balanced by the fame of the particular surgeon or physician.
But, in all honour to physicians and surgeons, who do in many cases
have and show a large-hearted sympathy for suffering, it must be remembered
that many of the greatest and busiest of them give hours of their
valuable time to those who are too poor to pay in any other form than
that of grateful thanks. There are, again, others who disregard all the
rules which govern trades’ union society, and boldly take their stand
upon Christ’s dictum, that “the Sabbath was made for man and not man
for the Sabbath.” In other words, they say that any medicine which
they personally find valuable in the alleviation of pain and disease must
be used even at the risk of themselves being called “unprofessional.”
Again, others will use these so-called secret remedies, and say
nothing about it, preferring to pin their faith to the wittily termed
eleventh commandment, “Thou shalt not be found out.” At this
point it is possible to draw a parallel between the use of the terms “untheosophical”
and “unprofessional.” It would seem that both are used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>in very much the same trades’ union sense. In the case of the word
“unprofessional,” it is to be regretted that it is due very largely to a lack
of charity and of the spirit of enquiry. In the case of the word “untheosophical”
it is often used in consequence of a lack of charity, and further
in the spirit of scandal and gossip. Unless a man or woman is a theosophist
pure and simple, who carries out in their <em>entirety</em>, the objects of the
Theosophical Society, the use of the word untheosophical betrays <em>them</em>
to be untheosophical and to fail in carrying out those objects which they
have promised to further to the best of their power.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the light of the foregoing it is now possible to examine the manner
in which Count Mattei’s remedies have been received. The Count himself
is a member of a noble family of Bologna, he has travelled much, but
returned there in 1847, and took part in the movement which led to the
liberation of Italy. In early life he much wished to study medicine, but
was prevented from doing so by his father’s wish. Still his desire for
knowledge was not quenched, and he attempted to follow the bent of his
own mind. He rightly concluded that the instincts of the lower animals
would lead them to search for herbs and plants which would cure their
ailments, and that careful observation of these instincts might disclose
medicines of the greatest value to human sufferers. Thus he adopted
the habit of taking walks in the company of a number of dogs which
were suffering from various diseases, and carefully watched their proceedings.
Gradually the new pharmacopœia assumed shape, and the instinct
of the dogs showed that particular diseases were met by particular
remedies. These observations were made more than sixty years ago,
and were not forgotten amid the occupations of a busy life. Indeed, when
those occupations became less, Count Mattei returned with ardour to his
earlier studies. He became a deputy in the Roman Parliament, but
retired into private life after finding that his political views were not
those of the men by whom he was surrounded. After this retirement
the Count devoted himself to the study of medicine, in order that he
might fit himself to apply certain principles which he believed he had
discovered to be valuable for sick and suffering humanity. By his own
account and the testimony of his patients he was not deceived, and the
present remedies which bear his name are the result of twenty-five years’
unceasing labour and experiment. He rapidly acquired an enormous
practice, and during the early years of it his advice and his medicines
were entirely gratis. But an unfortunate combination of circumstances,
as well as the expense entailed by the preparation of the remedies,
rendered it necessary for the Count to demand some small remuneration
for his services. Then he learned that his bounty was abused, and that
certain doctors, who had asked and obtained the remedies from him, departed
from Bologna and retailed the remedies at extravagantly exorbitant
prices. To such an extent was this carried that there exist authentic
cases where a thaler was demanded for a single globule, and for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>globules (20-30) necessary to give a bath, 1,000 francs were asked in New
York. Some idea of the extortion may be given when Count Mattei
refers to the thaler price as being 1,350 times the price at Bologna.
This would be enough to justify any amount of secrecy on Count
Mattei’s part, more especially as that secrecy entirely prevents the
adulteration of the medicines which would inevitably follow, were they to
become commercial property.</p>

<p class='c028'>We have only too familiar an example in the ranks of the medical
profession. Many of his confrères have been appealed to for the support
of a physician, named Warburg. At this date it seems hardly
possible to believe that this gentleman was the happy discoverer of
Warburg’s Fever Tincture. Perhaps in this country the value of the
compound was not so highly appreciated as in India. But it is impossible
to open any treatise on either surgery or medicine which is about
twenty years old and not find the use of Warburg’s tincture specially
urged in all cases of high fever, and especially in cases of malarial fever
and pyæmia. The compound had an enormous sale, and yielded a very
substantial income to its discoverer, but as soon as he yielded to
the pressure of professional opinion, and consented to publish his formula
so that it might obtain an extended use, he obtained the reward
of such philanthropy. Every chemist now prepares the prescription
and sells it at very nearly the original price, and what is more, never
refunds a fraction of a farthing in the shape of a royalty to the discoverer.
Consequently, we have before us the edifying spectacle of the
learned discoverer compelled to exist on the charity of his professional
confrères. Count Mattei has, at all events, protected himself against
this, for although he states that in the event of his death he has provided
against the loss of his secret to the world, and intends to leave it carefully
as a legacy to suffering humanity, there is not the slightest doubt
that he alone is the possessor of his own secret. That it is possible to
obtain wealth from using this system is very evident. Certain among
the chief of his followers are in the habit of visiting London at
intervals, and the number of those who consult them is really wonderful.
I am assured by an eye-witness that the crowd is far beyond
that which besieges the door of the most fashionable physician of the
day. When one reads the literature of the subject, one becomes more
and more astonished at its simplicity. All diseases resolve themselves
into three main forms, and constitutions vary accordingly. There are
sanguine and lymphatic constitutions, and the various combinations of
these two; there are also febrile disturbances and diseases of the liver
and spleen. Consequently there are three chief medicines, which
are used in an extraordinary state of dilution. It is no use, here at
least, to discuss the value of these infinitesimal doses, so that may be
left for future discussion. To a professional mind the most extraordinary
claim on Count Mattei’s part will be that of curing cancer by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>internal and external medicines, and wholly without the use of the
knife. He claims positively to cure every case in which the cancer
has not ulcerated, and to cure a large proportion even of those
which have already done so. Even of those which have been
neglected, and have remained long in the ulcerated state, he claims to
restore a certain proportion (though not a large one) to health. Of
course, to any man who has seen the difficulty which attends the early
diagnosis of cancer, these claims are very high-sounding indeed—almost
to absurdity. The difficulties which attend diagnosis, even almost to
the time when the knife <em>has been</em> used, and the tissue submitted to the
microscope, are very great. But in Count Mattei’s second division there
is no such difficulty. It is then possible by certain indications, as well
as by the use of the microscope, to be sure of the nature of the disease.
Here Mattei steps in and claims that, by the use of one of his medicines,
which exerts an <em>electric</em> influence on cancer, and by one of what he terms
his vegetable electricities, he can restore the sufferer to health. Surely
<em>conservative</em> surgery, if it be worthy of the name, will investigate such a
claim. Of the vegetable electricities there is no doubt whatever. Cases
of neuralgia and sciatica and articular rheumatic pain have been seen to
yield to them as to magic; consequently, even in the last stages of
cancer, when there is no refuge save the grave left to the sufferer, I have
reason to believe Count Mattei, to some extent, when he claims to enable
the said sufferer to sink gently away in full consciousness, and without
the use of morphia.</p>

<p class='c028'>To those who know anything of the occult uses and powers of plants,
the fact that Count Mattei gathers his herbs at particular phases of the
moon, will convey a good deal of meaning. Further, they will feel an
additional assurance as to their value, and will no longer wonder, on one
side at least, that Count Mattei chooses to keep his secret. It would
seem probable to some extent that Count Mattei is one of the “elder
brethren” of the race, although how far he is consciously so may be a
matter for speculation, which could only be set at rest by Mattei himself
and his compeers and superiors. What is definitely certain is that his
system of medicine in its theories, if not in its practice, is a distinct step
in advance in the healing art. Mattei is one of those pioneers of advance
who spend the greater part of their lives in introducing for public use a
secret of which they have become possessed. Mr. Keeley, of Philadelphia,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c013'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
appears to be another of those pioneers who are in advance of
their times. But Mr. Keeley, in his work, resembles Friar Bacon, who
blessed (?) the world with gunpowder. No doubt civilization has been
enormously extended by its aid; but however much use it may have
been to man in adapting the face of nature to his service, it has at any
rate subserved the gratification of his passions. Count Mattei appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>to have none of these “defects of his qualities,” and to have endeavoured
to bless the world without giving to it attendant curses. Still it is
always possible that when his secret shall become known it will draw
attention to plants which have just as destructive and poisonous an influence
as the plants and herbs he uses have of healing power. At all
events, at present his secret is of use to the world, and so far as may be
seen he makes a just and “brotherly” use of it. Has enough been said
above to show that the fact that his medicines are “secret” compounds
should be no barrier to their use? What is still more important is that
true theosophists should recognise that Count Mattei has done what they
endeavour to do, and devoted his life to Real Work.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY’S CONVENTION OF 1887.</h3>

<hr class='c049' />
<p class='c035'>Safely returned from my long tour of ten months, my first duty upon reaching
home is to remind the Branches that the time approaches for the Annual Meeting
of the Convention of the General Council—27th to 30th of December. It
appears that the attendance this year will be much larger than ever before; some
thinking that we shall register between 200 and 300 Delegates: besides the old,
there will be some twenty new Branches entitled to representation and votes.
The yearly extension of our Society is thus steadily augmenting the strength of
the General Council, and the importance of its Annual Convention. As the
Society settles gradually upon its constitutional basis, the volume of committee
and parliamentary work lessens and more time becomes available for theosophical
lectures, the formation of friendships, and the cultivation of a good mutual
understanding as to the work before us.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Adyar Library, to which considerable gifts of old MSS. and books have
been made since last December, is already being put to use. The Dwaita
Catechism was issued at the last Convention, and at this year’s the Vishistadvaita
and Advaita Catechisms will be ready; as will also a compilation of Buddhistic
Morals from the sacred literature of Ceylon. It is hoped that members of our
many Branches will kindly bring forward as many ancient works upon every
Department of Aryan knowledge as they can procure for this best of national
monuments, the Adyar Library.</p>

<p class='c028'>Every effort will be made to promote the comfort of Delegates, as heretofore.
Lectures are being arranged for, but learned Mofussil members who are willing
to read discourses upon special topics interesting to Delegates, are requested to
at once correspond with the Secretary, and if the MSS. are ready, to send them
in for approval.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>A REMARKABLE CHRISTMAS EVE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>It was a dark and solitary path, a narrow, hardly perceptible, footway
in a dense forest, hemmed in by two walls of impenetrable thorns
and wild creepers, covering, as with a net-work, the trunks of the
tall, bare, moss-covered trees. The path led through the woods down to
a deep valley in which a few country-houses were nestled. Night was fast
approaching, and the hurricane, that blew across the country, boded evil
to many a traveller, by land and sea. The wind, which had hitherto been
only moaning through the trees, in low sad tones reminding one of a
funereal dirge, was now beginning to roar with fury, filling the forest as
with the howling of a hundred hungry wolves. Very soon a drizzling,
ice-cold rain veiled the whole forest in a damp shroud of fog.</p>

<p class='c028'>One solitary traveller was wearily wending his way along this deserted
path. The hour was late, and the darkening shadows were creeping on
steadily, making the gloom in the thicket still more depressing. The
young man looked worn and tired, as he again and again brushed aside
the entangled briars which impeded his progress forward. He was well-dressed,
and wore a marine officer’s cap. But his coat was now in rags,
torn by the hard, frozen, cruel thorns, and his hands were bleeding in the
struggle he had had with the briars for a whole long night and a day
since he had lost his way in the huge forest. Panting, he stopped at
last; and, as he heaved a deep sigh, he fell down half-insensible at the
foot of an old shaggy oak. Then, half-opening his weary eyes, he
murmured in despair, as he placed his hand on his heart:—“I wonder
how long <em>this</em> will yet beat.... I feel as if it were gradually stopping.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He closed his eyes once more, and very soon the feeble palpitations
he was watching within himself, turned his half-paralysed thought into a
new groove of ideas. Now the hardly audible beatings of his heart
seemed to transform themselves into the ticking of an old clock quite
near to him. He imagined the old Nüremberg timepiece in his mother’s
room. He was dripping wet, chilled to the marrow of his bones, and
was fast losing consciousness. But, forgetting for one moment his
situation, and where he was, he caught himself soliloquising as was his
custom, when alone.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This clock,” he thought, “has to be wound up ... else it will stop.
So shall this heart. A man has to eat and drink to renew the fuel which
feeds life, the clock too ... no; the clock is different to man. Let it
rest for a week, for two, three months, even for a year.... Still, if wound
up again, it will tick on as merrily as ever. But once the supply of the
body is stopped—well, what then? Shall the working power cease for
ever, or the ticking of the heart be resumed as that of the clock? No,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>no!... You may feed the dead body of man as much as you please!
it shall awaken to life no more.... A queer problem to solve,—What
becomes of that something which made the body move? The food is
not the cause, is it?... No; the food is only the fuel.... There must
be some inward fire ever burning, as long as it is supplied.... But
when the supply of the fuel ceases? Ah!... that is it ... where does
it go?... Does anything really die?... What form shall <em>my</em> inner fire
take?... Shall it return to <em>its</em> primordial light ... and be no more?...
Oh, how I suffer!... No, no; I must not allow this, <em>my</em> fire, to go out.
No, not before I see once more my loved ones ... my mother and
Alice....”</p>

<p class='c028'>Arising with great effort he pursued his way with tottering steps, feeling
his way in the darkness. But instantly a wild gust of wind, tearing along
the narrow pathway, caused the great trees to sway and rock as if in very
agony. Catching in its icy clasp the weakened form of the young man,
the hurricane nearly upset him. Being already wet through and through
with rain and cold, he shivered and groaned aloud, as he felt a sharp
pain penetrating his limbs from the brain downwards. One more short
struggle and he heavily fell on the cold hard ground. Clasping his hands
over his brow, he could only whisper again: “Mother, I can do no
more.... Farewell, mother, for ever! Alice—fare thee well!”...</p>

<p class='c028'>His strength was gone. For over thirty hours he had tasted no food.
He had travelled night and day in the hope of being with his family on
Christmas Eve, that blessed day of joy and peace. Never yet had he
spent a Christmas Eve away from home; but that year had been an
unusually unfortunate one for him. His vessel had been wrecked and he
had lost all. It was only by the greatest of chances that he had been
enabled to find his way back to his country, in time to take the train
that brought him from a large seaport to the small town some twenty
miles’ distance from his home. Once there, he had to travel that distance
by coach. But just as he was preparing to start on his last journey, he
met a poor sailor, a companion of his shipwreck. With tears in his
eyes the man told him that having lost all, he had no more money left
to take him to his wife and children, who were yet two days’ journey by
rail from where he was; and that thus, he could not be with them to
make merry Christmas together. So the good-hearted young officer,
thinking he could easily walk the short distance that separated him
from home, had emptied his purse into the sailor’s hands and started
on his way on foot, hoping to arrive on that same evening.</p>

<p class='c028'>He set out early in the morning and bethought himself of a
short cut through the vast forests of his native place. But on that
afternoon he hurt his foot badly, and being able to move only at a very
slow pace, the night had overtaken him in the forest in which he had
finally lost his way during that terrible night. He had wandered since
the morning during the whole long day, until pain, exhaustion, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the hurricane had overpowered him. And now, he was lying helpless
on the bare frozen ground, and would surely die before the dawn.</p>

<p class='c028'>How long he lay there he never remembered; but, when he came
back to himself, he thought he could move, and resolved to make a last
supreme effort after the short rest. The wind had suddenly fallen. He
felt warmer and calmer now, as he sat leaning against a tree. Old habit
brought him back to his previous train of thought.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Never, mother dear, never,” he addressed her in thought, “never have
I spent a Christmas away from your dear selves.... Never, since my
boyhood, when father died twelve years ago! I made a vow then that,
come what would, I should spend each Christmas Eve at home; and
now, though life seems slowly ebbing out of my body, I want to keep
my promise. They must be waiting for me even now, they, and Alice,
my sweet fair cousin, who tells me she never loved but me! Reginald
and Lionel, my brothers, who are earnestly waiting for me; my shy
pretty May, and little Fanny.... They are all longing to see me, my
dear ones, all expecting their old brother Hugo to return and decorate
their Christmas-tree.... Oh, mother, mother, see you I must! I will be
with you on this Christmas Eve, come what may!”</p>

<p class='c028'>This passionate longing appeal seemed to give him a ten-fold strength.
He made a desperate effort to rise from his place, and found he could
do so quite easily. Then, overcome with joy, he flew rather than walked
through the dense black forest. He must have surely mistaken the
distance, as a minute later he found himself in the brushwood, and saw
the well-known valley so familiar to him, and even discerned in the
bright moonlight the home that contained all his dear ones. He ran
still faster, more and more rapidly, and even forgot in his excitement to
wonder whence he had found the power of using his lame foot so
easily.... At last he reached the lawn, and approached the cosy
old house, all wrapped in its snowy winter garments, and sparkling
in moonlight like a palace of King Frost. From a large bay-window
poured out torrents of light, and as he drew still nearer, trying to see
through it, he caught a glimpse of the loved faces, which he stopped to
look at, before knocking at the door....</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, my mother! I see her there,” he exclaimed. “There she is,
seated in her arm-chair, with her knitting by her side, her beautiful silvery
hair as soft and glossy as ever under her snow-white cap. I see her
kind eyes and placid features still unmarked by the furrows of age....
She looks troubled.... She listens to the fierce gusts of wind which
cause the windows to shake and rattle. How that wind <em>does</em> try to get
into the house, and, finding itself no welcome guest, hark, how it rolls
away.... How strange!... I <em>hear</em>, but I do <em>not feel</em> the wind....
Oh!... Kneeling at my mother’s feet, there’s Alice. Her arms are
clasped around mother’s knees; her golden curls fall on her back....
But—but, why are her large violet eyes filled with tears as she looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>with up-turned face into mother’s sad eyes?... Hush! What is she
saying?... I hear it, even through that wall....</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Don’t be uneasy, mother, dear, Hugo will come back. You know he
told us so in his last letter. He said that after their shipwreck he was
kindly cared for by those who saved the crew. He wrote also that he
had borrowed money for the journey, and that he would be with us at
the latest on Christmas Eve!... Bad roads and the stormy night will
have detained him.... The coach, you say? Well, and though the
coach has long since passed by, he may have taken a carriage. He will
soon be here, mother.’</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes5'></a>“Ah, dear Alice, I see—she looks at her finger, with its little ruby
ring I placed on it. She puts it to her lips, and I hear her murmuring
my name....</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>(From Hugo’s diary, where he recorded that night’s experience.)</p>

<p class='c028'>... I rushed into the house at that appeal, and, as I now remember,
without knocking at the door, as if I had passed through the stone walls.
I tried to speak, but no sound appeared to reach their ears. Nor did
anyone seem to see or greet me.... I drew Alice by the arm, but she
never turned round, only continued to murmur sweet words of consolation
into my mother’s ear. Good God, what agony! Why do they
not hear, or even see me.... Am I really here? I look round the room.
The old home is just as I had left it nine months since. There is my
father’s picture hanging over the mantel-piece, looking at me with his
kind smile; the old piano open, with my favourite song on it.... The
cat sleeping as usual, on the hearthrug, and purring, as she stretches out
her lazy paws. Albums on the table, my photograph, with its bright
and happy look! How different to my present self! Here am I, standing
in an agony of doubt, before my loved ones, seeing them, feeling them,
touching them ... and yet unseen by them, unnoticed, as one who is
not there.... Not even my shadow on the wall over their own. But
who then, am I?... Why have they grown so blind to my presence?
Why do their hearts and senses remain so dense? I try again and
again. I call them piteously by their names, but they heed me not.
My heart, my love, all is here, but my physical body seems far away.
Yes, it is far, far away, and now I see it, as it lies cold and lifeless in that
forest, where I must have left it. It is surely for <em>me</em>, not for that body,
that they care! And is it because I am no longer clothed with flesh that
I must be as only a breath, an empty naught, to them?...</p>

<p class='c028'>Full of despair, I turned away, and passing through the folding doors,
arrived in the adjoining room, where my young brothers and sisters
were busily occupied decorating the Christmas tree. There it stands,
the old friend of my youth. I see it, and even discern its resinous perfume....
Towering up towards the ceiling, its lower branches are
bending to the ground, laden with golden fruits, with toys and wax
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>tapers. My brothers and sisters are gathered around it. But Reginald
looks grave. I see him turning to May, and hear him saying:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Are you not anxious about Hugo? I wonder what can have become
of him!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I did not like to tell mother,” May replies with a little shiver, “but
I had a dreadful dream last night. I saw Hugo white and cold. He
looked sorrowfully at me, but when he tried to speak he could not. His
look haunts me still!” she softly sobbed, with tears rolling down her
cheeks.</p>

<p class='c028'>But now little Fanny gives a scream of delight. The child has discovered
among the Christmas presents a real pipe, a pipe with silver
bells.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, <em>this</em> shall be for Hugo, and then he will have music whenever he
smokes!” exclaims the little one, merrily laughing, and holding out the
toy in the direction where I am standing.</p>

<p class='c028'>For a moment I hope she sees me. I try to take the pipe, but
my hand cannot clasp it, and the toy seems to slip away from me
as if it were a shadow.... I try to speak again, but it is of no use
... they see me not, neither do they hear me!...</p>

<p class='c028'>Grieved beyond words, I left them, and returning into the next room,
went up straight to Alice, who was still at mother’s side, murmuring to
her loving words. I spoke again, I entreated, I besought them to look
at me, and my suffering was so great that I felt that death would be
preferable to this!</p>

<p class='c028'>Then came a last and supreme effort. Concentrating all my will, I
bent over Alice, and gasped out with my whole soul:</p>

<p class='c028'>“If ever you loved me, Alice, know and hear me now!” I exclaimed,
as I pressed my lips to hers.</p>

<p class='c028'>She gave a shudder, a start, and then, opening her eyes wider and
wider, she shrieked in terror:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Hugo! Hugo! Mother, do you see? Hugo is here!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She tried to clasp me in her arms, but her hands met together, and
only joined as if in prayer.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Hugo, Hugo, stay, why can I not touch you? Mother, look! look!
Here is Hugo!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She was growing wilder and more excited with every moment.</p>

<p class='c028'>My mother looked faint and frightened, as she said:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Alice, what is the matter, child? What do you see? Hugo is not
here!”</p>

<p class='c028'>The children, hearing Alice’s cry, flew into the room, all eager with
expectation.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where is Hugo? Where is he?” they prattled.</p>

<p class='c028'>I felt that I was invisible to all but Alice. She was the only one
to see <a id='corr278.44'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='me,'>me.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_278.44'><ins class='correction' title='me,'>me.</ins></a></span> Therefore, realizing that the body had to be saved from its
danger in the woods without loss of time, I drew her after myself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>all my will. I slowly moved towards the door, never taking my look off
her eyes. She followed me, as one in a state of somnambulism.</p>

<p class='c028'>My mother looked stunned and bewildered.</p>

<p class='c028'>Rising with difficulty from her place, she would have made for the
door also, but sank back into her arm-chair powerless and covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Boys, follow Alice,” said May. “Wait ... the carriage is there
ready to go after the doctor’s children. Take it. Call the gardener and
John to go with you. I will stay with mother.” And whispering to
Reginald, she added, “Tell John to take rugs and blankets ... but I
am afraid poor Hugo is dead!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She then turned to mother, who had fainted. I would see no more,
but <em>willing</em> Alice to follow me, I left the house.</p>

<p class='c028'>She came slowly after me, her face all white, her large eyes
full of a look of terror, but also of resolution in them. On she
would have gone on foot, in the drizzling rain, her golden hair all
flying about her head, had she been allowed to do so by my brothers
and servants. The strange cortege was ushered into the open carriage,
the coachman being ordered to follow her directions. On it went, as
speedily as the horse could go. I found myself floating now before
them, and, to my own amazement, sliding backwards, with my face
turned towards Alice, strongly willing that she should not lose sight of
me. Two hours afterwards, the carriage entered the brushwood, and they
were obliged to alight.</p>

<p class='c028'>The night was now very dark and stormy, and notwithstanding
the lanterns, the group made way with great difficulty into the
thicket. The wind had begun to blow and howl with the same fury
as when I had left the wood, and seemed to have caught them all in its
chilly embrace. The boys and servants panted and shivered, but
Alice heeded nothing. What cared <em>she</em> for that! The only thought of
my beloved was I, Hugo.... On, on we went, her tender feet wounded
with the brambles, and the wet sprays of branches brushing against her
white face. On, on she ran, till, with a sudden and loud cry of joy and
terror mixed, she fell down....</p>

<p class='c028'>At the same instant <em>I</em> collapsed, and <em>fell also on the ground, as it
seemed to me</em>; and then all became a blank.... As I learned later, at
that moment the boys drew near, and lowering their lanterns found
Alice with her arms clasped around a form, and when the lanterns were
placed close to it they saw before them the body of their brother
Hugo, a corpse!</p>

<p class='c028'>“Sure enough he is dead, the poor young master!” cried John, our
old servant, who was close behind.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, no!” Alice answered. “No, he is not dead.... His body is
cold, but his heart still beats. Let us carry him home.... Quick,
quick!”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Lifting up the body gently and placing it in the carriage they
covered it with rugs and shawls, and drove at a furious speed back
to our home. It was near midnight when the carriage stopped at
the gate.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Reginald, run on quickly and give the good news to mother!” cried
Alice. “Tell May to have hot bottles and blankets ready, on the sofa
in the drawing-room. It is warm there near the fire.... Tell them all
that Hugo lives, for I <em>know</em> he does,” she went on repeating.</p>

<p class='c028'>More lights were brought out, and the servants carried carefully their
burden into the house, where they placed it on the sofa, hot flannels and
restoratives being immediately applied. Noiselessly and breathlessly
went on the work of love around the apparently dead body, and was at
last rewarded. A sigh was heard, a deeper <em>breath</em> was drawn, and then
the eyes slowly opened and <em>I</em> looked round in vague surprise at all those
loved and anxious faces crowding eagerly around me.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Don’t speak yet, Hugo,” whispered Alice anxiously. “Don’t, till
you feel stronger.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But I could not control my impatience.</p>

<p class='c028'>“How am I here?” I asked. “Ah, I remember. I lost my way in
the old forest.... Ah, yes; I recollect now all.... The cold biting
wind, my lame foot, after I stumbled and fell, knocking my head against
a stone, and all became a blank to me!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Hush, Hugo, hush my boy,” said my mother wiping tears of joy
from her still pale and suffering face. “You will tell us all that
presently.... Now rest.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But I could not refrain from speaking, as thoughts crowded into my
head, and recollections came vividly back. “No, no, I am better,” I
went on. “I am strong again, and I must let you know all that I
dreamed. I was here, and I saw you all.... Oh, the torture I
suffered when you knew me not!... Mother, darling, did you not see
me, your son? But she, my Alice, saw and followed me, and it is she
who saved me from death! Ah, yes! I remember now, you found my
body, and then all was darkness again. Kiss me, mother! Kiss me all,
let me feel that I am really with you in body, and am no longer an invisible
shadow.... Mother I kept my promise; I am here on Christmas
Eve! Light the tree, my little Fan, and give me the pipe with the bells
I saw you holding, and heard you say it was for old brother Hugo.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The child ran into the other room and returned with the pipe I had
seen her playing with a few hours before. This was the greatest and
final proof for me, as for my family. The event was no vision then,
no hallucination, but true to its merest details! As my mother often
said afterwards, referring to that wonderful night, it was a weird and
strange experience, but one which had happened to others before, and
will go on happening from time to time. Of late years, when I had
been happily married to my Alice (who will not let me travel far away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>without her, any longer) I have dived a good deal into such psychic
mysteries, and I think I can explain my experience. I think that by
privation, cold, and mental agony, I had been thrown into such abnormal
conditions, that my astral body, as it is now generally called, my
“conscious self,” was able to escape from the physical tenement and take
itself to the home I so passionately desired to reach. All my thoughts,
and longings being intensely directed towards it, I found myself there
where I wished to be, in spirit. Then the agony of mind from the
consciousness that I was invisible to all, added to the fear of death
unless I could impress them with my presence, became finally productive
of the supreme effort of will, the success of which alone could save me.
This joined to Alice’s sensitiveness and her love for me, enabled her to
sense my presence, and even to see my form, whereas others saw nothing.
Man is a wonderful and marvellous enigma; but it is one which has to,
and <em>will</em>, be completely unriddled some day, the scepticism of the age
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c035'>Such is the simple story told to the writer by an old naval officer,
about the most “memorable Christmas Eve” that came within his own
experience.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>THEOSOPHY AND MODERN SOCIALISM.</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c034'>
    <div>BY A SOCIALIST STUDENT OF THEOSOPHY.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>The writer of the article on “Brotherhood” in your last issue has
given an erroneous impression of Socialism, which, as a student of
Theosophy (I do not know if I can yet call myself a disciple),
who has been, in a large measure, drawn to this great study <em>through
Socialism</em>, I may, perhaps, be allowed to correct. Indeed, I should feel
that I was shirking a task clearly indicated to me at the present
moment, were I to leave such errors, so far as all readers of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>
are concerned, uncorrected.</p>

<p class='c028'>“T.B.H.,” the writer of the article in question—an interesting and, I
believe, useful article in many respects—has, I venture to conjecture,
confused the general system or class of systems known as Socialism,
with certain methods of propagating its principles. Let me commence
by quoting the paragraph in his article to which I take exception. He
says (<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> No. 3, p. 213):—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>(1). “Socialism, as preached in this nineteenth century, it [the Universal Brotherhood,
which is the mainspring of Theosophy.—J.B.B.] certainly is not. (2). Indeed,
there would be little difficulty in showing that modern materialistic Socialism is
directly at variance with all the teachings of Theosophy. (3). Socialism advocates a
direct interference with the results of the law of <em>Karma</em>, and would attempt to alter
the dénouement of the parable of the talents by giving to the man, who hid his talent
in a napkin, a portion of the ten talents acquired by the labour of his more industrious
fellow.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>I will first take the three statements contained in this paragraph
separately, and, for convenience’s sake, in inverted order. The allegation
against Socialism contained in the third is the most specific, and that
which, in the eyes of Theosophists, must appear the most serious. This
statement, namely, that “Socialism advocates a direct interference with
the results of the law of Karma, and would attempt &amp;c.,” constitutes, in
fact, the only definite premise in his argument. Of course, if Socialists
do advocate, consciously or unconsciously, anything of the sort, they
advocate a physical and psychical impossibility, and their movement is
fore-doomed to failure. More than this, if they do so <em>consciously</em>, they
are sinning against the light, and are impious as well as childish in their
efforts. Of such, clearly, the Universal Brotherhood is not.</p>

<p class='c028'>But neither Socialists nor Socialism, “as preached in this nineteenth
century,” do anything of the kind. By “Materialistic” Socialism, I
presume “T.B.H.” implies (if he has really <em>studied</em> Socialism at all,
which I venture to doubt) so much of it as can be urged upon
purely worldly grounds, such as the better feeding, housing, &amp;c., of
those who do the active work of society, technical instruction, such
general education as fits a man for the domestic and secular duties of
life, and the reorganisation of society with these objects upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“co-operative” basis,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c013'><sup>[61]</sup></a> in which public salaried officers, elected by their
fellows, will take the place of capitalists and landlords, and in which the
production and distribution of wealth will be more systematically
regulated. This system, of course, takes no account of the law of
Karma.</p>

<p class='c028'>In a rough sort of way, however, all Socialists recognise the law, so
far as its effects are visible in this world on the physical, intellectual, and
moral planes. The fact that “the evil that men do,” and classes and
nations of men also, “lives after them,” none are more ready to own and
act upon. The action and reaction of individual <em>will</em> and individual and
social <em>circumstance</em>, both upon each other and upon individual and social
<em>conditions</em>, forms part of the foundations of Socialism. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quâ</i></span> Socialists
we do not, of course, take any more account of the law of Karma than
do non-Socialist Christians and Agnostics, but I maintain there is nothing
whatever in Socialism repugnant to a <a id='corr283.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beliet'>belief</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_283.15'><ins class='correction' title='beliet'>belief</ins></a></span> in this law. If anything,
it is the other way. All Socialists, whether they call themselves Collectionists
or Anarchists, Christian Socialists,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c013'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Communists, or purely
economic Socialists, are anxious to give freer play to human
abilities and social impulses, by creating leisure and educational
opportunities for all. We may thus, if it is permitted to me to
speculate while criticising, become the instruments of a greater equalisation,
distribution, and acceleration of Karmic growth, “good” or
“evil,” upon and among individual souls, during their incarnation on this
planet. This would come to pass by the transferring of a great deal of
the responsibility for Karmic results which now lies with each individual
in his personal capacity, upon the collective entities composed of individuals
acting in public capacities; <i>e.g.</i>, as nations, provinces, communes,
or trade corporations.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is surely true, even now, to speak of a collective, <i>e.g.</i>, a national or
municipal Karma, as we do of a national conscience. We speak of
reward or retribution to nations and cities as if they had distinct
personalities—are these mere “figures of speech”? But what is more
important is that Socialists may prepare the way for a revelation of the
noble truths of Theosophy to the multitude; they may help to raise
the intellectual and instinctive moral standard of the whole community
to such an extent that all will, in the next generation following after the
Social Revolution,<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c013'><sup>[63]</sup></a> be amenable to those truths. In this way Socialism
would not, indeed, interfere with the results of the law of Karma, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>would, as the precursor of Theosophy, be the indirect means of enabling
multitudes to rise and free themselves from its bonds.</p>

<p class='c028'>As to the parable of the talents, well, Socialists would be only too
glad to see its moral better enforced in this and other “civilised”
countries. To them it seems impossible that it could be <em>less</em> enforced or
taken to heart than it is now. They see that under the present system
of Society—that vast engine of usury by which whole classes are held
in economic servitude to other classes—many are encouraged to live in
sloth and hide their talents, even if they put them to no worse uses than
that. This could hardly happen under a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span> of economic Socialism
(such a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span>, for instance, as Laurence Grönlund contemplates in his
“Co-operative Commonwealth”); for these able-bodied or talented
citizens who declined to work would simply be left to starve or sponge
upon their relatives. Under a purely communist <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>régime</i></span>,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c013'><sup>[64]</sup></a> no doubt
there would be a few who would shirk their proper share in the social
work, but at least none would be brought up from infancy, as now, to
“eat the bread of idleness.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Finally on this point, if to advocate such changes as Socialists
advocate, the substitution of social co-operation for competition; of production
with a view to use, for production with view to profit; of peace
between nations, classes, and individuals, for war; of harmonious organisation
to the advantage of all, for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laissez faire</i></span>, and chaos for the
advantage (or supposed advantage) of a few. If I say, to advocate
such changes be to advocate interference with the results of the law of
Karma, so is every proposal for the amelioration of the physical or
intellectual welfare of our fellows. And if participation in this and other
movements, which may with equal justice be called “materialistic,” be
prohibited to Theosophists, they may as well, for all good their
Universal Brotherhood will do to the mass of those at present outside
it, stay at home and content themselves with communing with the
select few who alone will ever be in a position to <a id='corr284.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='appreciaie'>appreciate</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_284.31'><ins class='correction' title='appreciaie'>appreciate</ins></a></span> them. If,
for one reason or other, they do not care to co-operate with Socialists,
let them, at least, recognise that the latter are preparing their way for
them, doing the dirty (?) and laborious work, without which Theosophy
can never descend from the serene heights in which it now dwells, to
replenish, spiritually, this sadly benighted world. For, apart from a
healthier physical and psychical atmosphere than “civilised” life engenders
in either rich or poor (collective Karmic effects), a fair amount
of leisure and freedom from sordid care are indispensable in most
human beings for the higher development of the perceptive or gnostic
faculties. At present this minimum of leisure and economic independence
is probably unattainable by nineteen-twentieths of the population.
Yet this self-same society, with its scientific learning and experience, its
machinery, and its business organisation, contains within it all the germs
of such a reconstruction of the physical environment as shall very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>shortly place the means of spiritual and psychical regeneration within
the reach of all.</p>

<p class='c028'>“T. B. H.’s” second statement is that “Indeed there would be very
little difficulty in showing that modern materialistic Socialism is directly
at variance with all the teachings of Theosophy.” Such an expression
as “materialistic Socialism” is, as I have already hinted, erroneous.
<em>All</em> Socialism is materialistic in the sense that it concerns itself primarily
with the material or physical conditions of mankind. So do chemistry
and mechanics, pure or applied; so, in ordinary politics, do Liberalism
and Conservatism. <em>No</em> Socialism is materialistic in the sense that it is
based upon any materialistic, as distinct from spiritualistic or pantheistic
conceptions of the universe. It has hardly any more to do with such
questions than have cotton-spinning or boot-making. I do not, however,
pretend to mistake “T. B. H’s” meaning. Taking Socialism in its essentially
economic aspect (which I admit is the foremost for the present,
and must remain so until it has been disposed of), he asserts that “there
would be very little difficulty in proving &amp;c.” This is a mere general
charge against it, although, I think, a less plausible, and therefore—from
the point of view of harmony between Socialists and Theosophists—a
less serious one, than the particular charge which follows it, and with
which I have already endeavoured to deal. For my own enlightenment,
I should be glad to have some samples, taken at random, of his skill in
showing this variance; but I doubt if such a demonstration could effect
any good. Meanwhile it is impossible to <em>answer</em> the charge on account
of its vague, albeit sweeping and all-comprehensive character. “All
the teachings of Theosophy” are quite too much for a student like
myself to attempt to compare with Economic Socialism, as a system;
nor do I think one with ten times the learning and discernment that I
can claim, would readily attempt it. I merely record, therefore, my
sincere conviction that on this general point “T. B. H.” is also mistaken,
and that it is not Socialism, economic, or otherwise, which he has really
been scrutinising and balancing, but the sayings or doings of some particular
“Socialist,” whom he has seen or read of.</p>

<p class='c028'>Individual Socialists have, of course, many faults which cannot fairly
be charged to the social and economic tenets they profess. Thus one
besetting fault of militant advocates of the cause is the use of violent
language against individual capitalists, police officials and landlords. It,
is so easy, even for men of a calibre superior to the average, to be drawn
on from righteous indignation at a corrupt system, to abuse of the creatures
and instruments thereof—or even, on occasion, to personal violence
against them. Every good cause has its Peters, no less than its Judases.
Socialism unfortunately has a rich crop of the former. Another still
worse fault on the part of certain agitators, but one which might easily
be predicted from the character of the struggle and the condition of the
classes who must form the backbone of the Socialist Party, is the frequent
appeal to lower motives, such as revenge and love of luxury.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>But such faults, although by all human prevision necessary incidents
in the movement, are by no means inherent in Socialism. Even the
purely “materialistic” socialism of Karl Marx, to which “T. B. H.”
seems (although I think not with any clear picture of it in his mind) to
refer, aims simply at securing the decencies and ordinary comforts of life
to all, as a recompense for more evenly distributed social labour. The
very conditions of life under a co-operative commonwealth such as Hyndman,
Grönlund, and other followers of the late Karl Marx’s economic
ideal, have in view—above all the obligation (virtual, at any rate) under
which every able-bodied member of the community would find himself
or herself, to do a few hours of useful work of one kind or another every
day, and the elimination of the commercial and speculative element,
with the wretched insecurity and dangerous temptations which it involves,—would
preclude inordinate luxury. A healthy simplicity of life would
become, first, “fashionable,” then usual.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c013'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Communism, of course, goes
further than economic socialism, as it implies not only the claim of the
individual upon the community for the means of <em>labour</em> and the enjoyment
of its fruits or their equivalent, but his claim for <em>subsistence</em>, irrespective
of the amount and social value of the labour which he is able to
perform. It would abolish, therefore, not only individual property in
the means of production, but in the products themselves. The practicability
of Communism, the motto of which is, “From each according to
his abilities, to each according to his needs,” obviously depends upon the
prevalence of more generous motives, of a higher sense of duty both to
work and to give—a more perfect development, in fact, of the sense of
human solidarity. It is for this very reason more commendable than
mere economic socialism, as an ideal, to the attention of Theosophists;
although its application, on the national or universal scale, cannot yet
be said to have entered “the sphere of practical politics.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Communism, which may be either Collectivist or Anarchist, leads me
to add a few words about Anarchism. I refer, of course, to the social ideal
philosophically denoted by this name, and not to the means advocated
by some of its supporters for putting an end to the present society.
Anarchism involves Communism, as well as extreme decentralisation;
more than this, it involves the abolition of all permanent machinery of
law and order, such as “the State” is supposed to provide, and the
abolition of physical force as a method of suasion, even for criminals and
lunatics. As a protest against political domination of all kinds, and an
antidote to the excessive centralisation advocated by some state-Socialists,
Anarchism may be of some use, but it is obviously further even than
Communism (of the Collectivist variety) from becoming a school of
“practical” politics. It could only become so after society at large, all
the world over, had grown sufficiently homogeneous and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>solidaire</i></span> for its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>members to co-operate spontaneously and automatically for all necessary
purposes, grouping themselves into large or small organizations (limbs
and organs) as required, and forming a complete <em>body-social</em>, or Mesocosm,
if I may be allowed to coin a word for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c028'>The erroneous conceptions of Socialism which I believe “T. B. H.” to
have formed, do not necessarily invalidate the first statement in the
paragraph of his article upon which I have been commenting, to wit, that
the Universal Brotherhood which he has in view (and which, I understand
from him, forms the first part of the programme of the Theosophical
Society) is not “Socialism as preached in this 19th century,”—or at any
other time, past or future, for that matter. Still, I am inclined to hope
that a more intimate study of Socialism will lead him to see that, whether
identical or not, they are at any rate not antagonistic. My own belief is
that Theosophy and “materialistic” Socialism will be found to be working
along different planes in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c028'>Any Universal Brotherhood of Theosophists must be based upon
Socialist principles, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>inter alia</i></span>: its foundations may extend further and
deeper than those of Socialism, but cannot be less extensive. Greed and
War (political or industrial) Social Caste and Privilege, Political Domination
of Man over Man, are as out of place in a true Brotherhood as
wolves in a flock of sheep. Yet the exclusion of these anti-social demons
and the enthronement in their place of Universal Love and Peace, if
effected by such a Brotherhood, would simply leave Socialists nothing
to do but to organize the material framework of their co-operative commonwealths.
To preach economic or “materialistic” Socialism to a
world already converted to the highest and completest form of Socialism,
would be to advocate the plating of gold with tin or copper.</p>

<p class='c028'>Modern Socialism, if the noble aspirations of some of its apostles may
be taken as an earnest of its future, is already developing (incidentally,
of course, to its main economic and ethical doctrines) strong æsthetic
and spiritual tendencies. No reader of William Morris or Edward
Carpenter, to speak of English Socialists only, will fail to notice this. At
present the mass of Socialists content themselves with basing their social
and economic faith upon the ethical principles of Justice, Freedom and
Brotherhood. But the highest, because most mystical of these principles,
that of Brotherhood, or better, Human Solidarity—the ancient conception
of “Charity”—forms the unconscious link between modern Socialism
on the one hand, and Esoteric Buddhism, Esoteric Christianity, and
Theosophy generally, on the other. I say <em>unconscious</em> link, but I mean
to imply that it may soon be rendered conscious and visible. As the
various “orthodox” varieties, first of Christianity, then of Mohammedanism,
perish with the destruction or collapse of the Social systems that have
grown up along with them, this simple religion of Human Solidarity will
take possession of the deserted shrines of Christ and Allah, and will
begin to seek out its own fount of inspiration. Then will be the time
for the Universal Brotherhood of Theosophists to step into the breach.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The loss of youth and love is the perpetual wail of the poets. A
never-changing spring-time of life, where the sweet dreams of
youth would be realised in the fruition of reciprocal love, such
would be a heaven to them, and such <em>is</em> a heaven while it lasts. If we
add to this the refined æsthetic taste that can delicately balance and
appreciate to a nicety every joy of the senses, and the highly-developed
intellect which can roam at will over the accumulated store of past ages
of culture, what would there be left for poets to dream of? With heart,
senses and mind worthily employed, and with the well-balanced nature
that knows moderation alone can give continued bliss, could not man
rest satisfied at last? What more could he desire?</p>

<p class='c028'>It is useless to deny that life has very sweet gifts to give, though the
number is limited of those who are capable of receiving them in their
fulness. But even while these gifts are being enjoyed, it is felt that the
horizon is bounded. With what questioning uncertainty—albeit with
fascination—does youth open its eyes upon the glamour of the dazzling
world! The love of the Springtide, even in fruition, is continually
building fairy bowers in the future—it never for long rests content in the
present, while to the intellect the bounded scope of utmost learning is a
still more definite goad towards a knowledge that shall transcend all
past experience.</p>

<p class='c028'>And even were man content to continue to drink of the one cup of
bliss, he is never allowed to do so. The lessons of life, the great teacher,
are continually being altered, and the tempest of the heart takes the
place of the calm that was never expected to end.</p>

<p class='c028'>If, then, we must look in vain to find permanent bliss in any of these
things—if, beyond the highest intellectual culture of an intellectual age
there gleams the vision of a higher knowledge—if behind the artistic refinement
of this, as of all past flowers of civilization, the fount of all
sweetness lies hid—if even the heart-binding communion of earthly
love is but a faint reflex of the deep peace realized by him who has torn
aside the veil that hides the Eternal, surely all man’s energies should
be devoted to the quest which will yield him such results.</p>

<p class='c028'>The whole philosophy of life may be summed up in the Four great
Truths that Buddha taught, and no more convincing description of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>can be read than that given in the lovely lines of the eighth book of the
“Light of Asia.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He who has once been deeply imbued with these great truths—who
has realised the transitory nature of all earthly bliss, and the pains and
sorrows that more than counterbalance the joys of life—will never in
his truest moments desire to be again blessed, either in the present or in
any future incarnation, with an uniformly happy life, for there is no such
soporific for the soul as the feeling of satisfaction, as there is no such
powerful goad as the feeling of dissatisfaction. He is bound to pass
through periods of joy, but they will be looked forward to with fear
and doubting, for then it is that the sense-world again fastens its
fangs on the soul, to be followed by the pain of another struggle for
freedom.</p>

<p class='c028'>When first setting out on the great quest, it seems as if many lifetimes
would fail to appease the dominant passion of the soul, but nature
works quickly in the hottest climates, and from the very intensity of the
desire may spring the strength and will to conquer it. Though it is
probably the same key-note that is struck throughout, the dominant
desire will appear to take a different tone through the ascending scale
of life. It is a speculation, but one which would seem to receive endorsement
from the analogies of nature; for as the human embryo in its antenatal
development, exhibits in rapid succession, but with longer pauses
as it approaches the period of birth, the characteristics of the lower
races of animal life from which man has evolved, so does the human
soul realise in its passage through life the dominant desires and attractions
which have affected it through countless past incarnations. The
lower desires which in past lives may have been more or less completely
conquered, will be experienced in rapid succession and left behind without
much difficulty, till the great struggle of the life is reached, from
which man must come out more or less victorious if he is to continue the
progress at all.</p>

<p class='c028'>If right intention were the only thing needed, if it were a guarantee
against being led astray, or if straying did not necessitate retardation on
the road, there would be no such supreme necessity that belief should
be in accordance with facts; but even in worldly affairs we see every
day that purity of intention is no guard against the failures that come
from lack of knowledge. In the great spiritual science therefore, which
deals with the problem of life as a whole—not the mere fragment which
this earthly existence represents—it will be seen how vitally necessary it
is that facts should be conceived correctly.</p>

<p class='c028'>To us whose eyes are blinded to the heights above, by the mists of our
own desires, the only rays of light which can illumine the darkness of
our journey on the great quest, are the words (whether or not in the
form of recognised revelation) left by the masters who have preceded us
on the road, and the counsel of our comrades who are bound for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>same goal. But words are capable of many interpretations, and the
opinions of our comrades are coloured by their own personality—the
ultimate touch-stone of truth must therefore be looked for in the
disciple’s own breast.</p>

<p class='c028'>Having stated the necessity for correct belief, let us now consider the
question of the great achievement—the annihilation of Karma—the
attainment of Nirvana. It must be acknowledged as a logical proposition
that Karma can never annihilate Karma, <i>i.e.</i>, that no thoughts
words, or acts of the man in his present state of consciousness, can,
ever free him from the circle of re-births. This view would seem to
necessitate some power external to the man to free him—a power
which has touch of him, and which would have to be allied to him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Now the teachings which have been put before the world in “Light
on the Path” state the other side of the question. “Each man is to
himself absolutely the <em>way</em>, the <em>truth</em>, and the <em>life</em>.” And again, “For
within you is the light of the world, the only light that can be shed on
the Path. If you are unable to perceive it within you, it is useless to
look for it elsewhere.” It would seem that the solution of this great
paradox must be sought for in the constitution of man, as described
in theosophic writings. Indeed, it is the scientific statement of deep
spiritual truths which gives to the Theosophic teachings their remarkable
value, and which seems likely to carry conviction of their truth to the
Western peoples, who have for too long been accustomed to the mere
emotional sentimentality of the orthodox religions, and to the pessimistic
negation of science.</p>

<p class='c028'>The higher principles, as they have been called, in the constitution of
man, particularly the divine Atma, through which he is allied to the all-pervading
Deity, must ever remain deep mysteries. But at least they are
cognisable by the intellect, as providing logical stepping-stones for spanning
the great gulf between Humanity and Divinity,—the Power—the
correct cognition of which provides the very link between both systems
of thought—which is at the same time external to man, and
has touch of him by its own divine light which enlightens him, and
which is also the very man himself—his highest and truest Self.</p>

<p class='c028'>For most of us it is the “God hidden in the Sanctuary,” of whose very
existence we are unaware, is known under the name of Iswara or the
Logos—the primal ray from the Great Unknown. It is the Chrestos of
the Christians, but, save, perhaps, to a few mystics in the Roman or Greek
churches, it has been degraded past recognition by their materialistic
anthropomorphism. A help to its better understanding may be obtained
by a reference to Sanscrit philosophy, which describes man’s nature as
consisting of the three <em>gunas</em> or qualities—Satwa, goodness, Rajas, passion
and Tamas, darkness, or delusion—and the nature of most men is made
up almost entirely of the two last named—while the Logos is pure
Satwa.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>The vexed question, therefore, as to whether man is freed by his own
dominant will, or by the power of the Logos, will be seen to be very much
a distinction without a difference. For the attainment of final liberation
the God within and the God without must co-operate.</p>

<p class='c028'>Desire being, as Buddha taught, the great obstacle in the way, its conquest
by the dominant will is the thing that has to be done, but the
Divine will cannot arise in its power, till the conviction of the Supreme
desirability of attaining the eternal condition is rendered permanent;
and it is this that necessitates the goad which the Logos is continually
applying by its light on the soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>We are now face to face with a very difficult problem—it is, in fact
the gulf which separates the Occultist from the Religionist, and it is
here that it is so necessary to get hold of the correct idea.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>The short cut to perfection referred to in the first two lines has been
called in Theosophic writings “the perilous ladder which leads to the
path of life.” To have faced the fearful abyss of darkness of the first
trial, without starting back in terror at the apparent annihilation which
the casting aside of the sense-life implies, and out of the still more awful
silence of the second trial; to have had the strength to evoke the greater
Self—the God that has hitherto been hidden in the sanctuary—such is
the language used with reference to the very first—nay, the preliminary—steps
on this path, while the further steps are represented by the
ascending scale of the occult Hierarchy, where the neophyte or chela,
through a series of trials and initiations, may attain the highest Adeptship,
and the man may gradually leave behind him his human desires
and limitations, and realise instead the attributes of Deity.</p>

<h4 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Introduction.</span></h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The readers of the curious article which follows are requested to remember
that the writers of signed papers in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, and not the editors,
are responsible for their contents. Captain Serjeant’s views excite much
interest among a large number of earnest people, who use Biblical forms and
phraseology to picture to themselves the hidden things of nature and of spirit—things
which we, the editors, and also the large majority of Theosophists, believe
to be more clearly conveyed under the symbolism of the ancient Wisdom-Religion
of the East, and better expressed in its terminology. The article is an
attempt to explain the significance of a very curious cloud formation observed
by many persons in Scotland, on the 16th of September last, a sketch of which
appeared in the <cite>St. Stephens Review</cite> on the 24th of the same month. In the
centre of the sketch appears a side view of the British Lion rampant, with his
paw on the head of a bearded man, who bears a considerable likeness to Mr.
Parnell; to the right of the Lion is an excellent likeness of Her Majesty,
crowned, as in the <a id='corr292.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Jubileee'>Jubilee</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_292.17'><ins class='correction' title='Jubileee'>Jubilee</ins></a></span> coinage, and smiling very naturally; and to the left
of the picture is an Irish harp. The appearance, by the testimony of many
witnesses, must have been remarkably perfect and striking. Cloud-forms of a
similar kind have been recorded many times in history, and they are usually
connected in the public mind with some important political event. The Cross
of Constantine will, no doubt, recur to the readers’ mind, but the sword and
reversed crescent, which everyone saw in the sky when the Turks were driven
out of Vienna, may be less generally known; as also the reversed thistles, with
the outline of a Scotchman, armed with claymore and targe, and falling backward,
which was observed in the clouds by the King and Court at Windsor on the
night before the battle of Culloden.</p>

<p class='c028'>The question of what <a id='corr292.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='interpretatation'>interpretation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_292.28'><ins class='correction' title='interpretatation'>interpretation</ins></a></span> is to be put upon remarkable cloud
appearances, is of little interest to anyone who believes that such phenomena are
merely accidental arrangements of the watery vapours of the atmosphere driven
by currents of air. Apart, however, from the obvious consideration that this
way of regarding the phenomenon only raises the further question of what
causes the currents of air to run in these particular ways, it may be safely said
that the chances are millions of millions of millions to one, against the appearance
in the clouds of any such perfect and complete picture of well-known
persons and emblems, as were seen in Scotland on the 16th of September. Of
course it may be argued, on the other hand, that the clouds are for ever forming
and re-forming in millions of millions of millions different ways, and that
the mathematical chances are that one of these ways will occasionally represent
an earth scene. But even if the infinite number of continual permutations and
transformations of cloud substance be held to account for the occasional
appearance of some graphic picture of human things, it does not in any way
explain why these rare pictures, when they do occur, should be perfect and
appropriate symbols; neither does it account for their appearance at the particular
moment when the extraordinary events, to which they are appropriate,
are occurring, or about to occur.</p>

<p class='c028'>The phenomenon of vapours and fumes taking the shape of persons and
things, is one of the oldest and best accredited facts in magic, and these cloud
appearances, if they be viewed as having any significance, are merely instances
of a similar action on a large scale produced by some conscious or unconscious
force in nature.</p>

<p class='c028'>If it be allowed, however, that the occasional assumption by vapours of the
shapes and likenesses of terrestrial things is not a “fortuitous concourse of atoms,”
but occurs in accordance with some obscure law of Nature that in itself is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>result of the mutual interaction and interdependence of everything in the
Universe, the important question still remains—whether these appearances, when
they do occur, are “intended” as warnings or omens? Should the lion, the
harp, her Majesty, and Mr. Parnell, of the Scottish cloud-picture, be taken as
having any more significance in the affairs of the nation, or of the world at large,
than chemical phenomena can be supposed to presage disturbances or rejoicings
in the world of nature? To answer this question would involve considerations
which only an advanced Occultist would be able to comprehend; so we shall
merely say, that although there are natural symbols which carry in them a definite
meaning for those who can read that secret language, still symbols are generally
significant in proportion as people themselves put a significance into them.</p>

<p class='c028'>A triangle or a cube is nothing but a triangle or a cube to a yokel, but to an
Occultist they contain the philosophy of the Universe. Even so, Captain
Serjeant, “the New Dispensationist,” and Theosophist, can put the meaning he
likes into this or any other symbolical representation. We do not quite agree
with either his methods or his results in the case before us, but the conclusions
he draws are the same that are now being reached by many minds pursuing very
different paths; and these conclusions may be summed up by saying that great
changes are approaching, both in the temporal and in the spiritual life of
humanity, and that these changes will eventuate in better things and nobler ideas.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus may be interpreted the symbolical appearance represented and described
in the <i>St. Stephen’s Review</i> of 24th September 1887. The lion<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c013'><sup>[66]</sup></a> of the house
of Judah<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c013'><sup>[67]</sup></a> arises with Victoria<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c013'><sup>[68]</sup></a> the female principle of the victor<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c013'><sup>[69]</sup></a> of this world
of ignorance, error, sin, crime and misery. The lion represents that wisdom
which is the only true and lasting power on earth. He shall crush out the
anarchy and confusion now so manifest in <em>the world</em> which is the state of
ignorance existing on this earth. Without a miracle shall all this be accomplished?</p>

<p class='c028'>As insidious doubt has crept into the hearts of the children of men, so shall
insidious truth creep in to dispel all doubt; ignorance developed into wisdom
shall be the destruction of the world.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c013'><sup>[70]</sup></a> Ignorance is the former or lower
expression of knowledge, and knowledge is the former or lower expression of
wisdom—ignorance<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c013'><sup>[71]</sup></a> is the cross—wisdom is the crown. Ignorance regarded in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>true light is really an incentive to knowledge, for no man would try to attain
to knowledge were he not ignorant. And no man would strive to attain to
wisdom, did he not possess the knowledge which ever silently proclaims to him
its crowning happiness. Wisdom is not only the celestial crown which every
embodied soul is ultimately destined to possess, but it is also that particular
state of Heaven called the “New Jerusalem” which shall descend from the
Spirit (<i>i.e.</i> God, see John iv., 24.) to earth in these latter days (see Revelation
xxi.)</p>

<p class='c028'>Man was created<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c013'><sup>[72]</sup></a> an ignorant being for a great purpose, which he will
ultimately realise and know. Were there no ignorance, there could be no error,
without error there could be no sin. Were there no ignorance, no sin, there
could be no crime, no unhappiness, no misery existing on the earth. When,
therefore, general ignorance shall succumb to the disintegrating power of
universal intelligence so rapidly developing in these latter days<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c013'><sup>[73]</sup></a> (see Daniel
xii., 4), and which is the quickening of the Spirit of God in man; then the
very conditions responsible for evolving error, sin, crime, unhappiness, and
misery will be entirely done away with, and thus the consummation of the age—or,
as the old translation of the Bible has it, the end of the world—will be
brought about as a necessary consequence of purification by the Fire of the
Spirit, <em>Truth</em>, which is the Divine Son of the Supreme Spirit, or God. “When
He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall guide you into all the Truth”; then
shall the princes of the House of David<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c013'><sup>[74]</sup></a> arise from amongst the people to rule
the nations in equity and justice, in prosperity and peace, and the reign of the
One Almighty Spirit of Wisdom, Love, and Truth shall begin on earth—for
the Lion (or wisdom) shall lie down with the Lamb (or innocence), and a little
child (or truth, see Rev. xii., the coming man-child) shall lead them.</p>

<p class='c028'>The soul-stirring and elevating harp of the sweet and trusting daughters of
Judah<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c013'><sup>[75]</sup></a> is hushed—no crown surmounts it; and angels weep and mourn over
the discord now prevailing in the world. Where are the harmonious chords
which, through their inherent, soft, loving and sympathetic notes once rendered
powerless that enemy of man—the serpent? Lost, through the ignorance and
sin of the puny earth-worms of this world! Yet Ireland, in common with the
whole earth, shall be freed ere long from the yoke of ignorance which is so
sorely oppressing all God’s creatures, for the crowned female head symbolically
represents the “Sign in Heaven” <em>which has appeared</em>, of the Victoria or the
woman<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c013'><sup>[76]</sup></a> clothed with the Sun, the Divine Mother from whom will proceed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Child of Wisdom, Love and Truth, who shall rule all nations with a rod of
iron,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c013'><sup>[77]</sup></a> and who shall be caught up unto God and unto His Throne.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c013'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes6'></a>The following quotation from one of the replies to two leading articles, which
appeared in the <cite>Manchester Courier</cite> of May 4th and 13th, may also tend to
throw some light on the vision of the crowned female head: “The present
year heralds the jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, on whose glorious
Empire the sun never sets. It shall also proclaim the jubilee of another Queen
Victoria, well known to the ancients as the Bride of God who awaits the arrival
of the Bridegroom. This Queen is She of Sheba<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c013'><sup>[79]</sup></a>—the female principle of the one
who is the Victor<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c013'><sup>[80]</sup></a> of this world of ignorance and darkness, sin and crime; and
He is the Solomon,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c013'><sup>[81]</sup></a> or Man of Light, Truth and Life Eternal. On her
glorious empire the golden rays of Love and Peace shall shine forth from the
Living Sun which nevermore shall set. She is the woman clothed with the Sun,
and from her will proceed the promised man-child who shall rule all nations
with a rod of iron, and shall be caught up unto God and unto His Throne.
Were the English nation but to realise the mighty import of the grand and
everlasting truths which I now proclaim, it would, to a man, support us in
that work in which we, the New Dispensationists, daily and hourly labour in the
interests of a suffering humanity now being slowly ground to powder in the stern
mill of social ignorance and degradation. The time has come for the promise
to be made known of the fulfilment of the “Saving health of all nations”; the
prophecies of the ancients relating to the ultimatum of the written Word of
Truth clearly point to the present age; and the Eternal Fiat has gone forth
from the Universal King: “Write, for these words are faithful and true”—“Behold,
I make all things new.” (Revelation xxi, 5.)</p>

<p class='c028'>It is fashionable in the world to covertly sneer at the things of the Spirit, and
to regard the Living God in Heaven as a Being either unable or unwilling to
manifest His Almighty Power and Presence to the world in this orthodox
nineteenth century. To all who may be inclined to ignorantly hold what I have
here written to be the outcome of a disordered imagination I would say, in
the words of Paul, an apostle: “not of men, neither by men.”—“We speak
wisdom among the full-grown, yet a wisdom, not of this world, nor of the rulers of
this world, <em>which are coming to nought</em>: but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery,
even the wisdom that hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds
unto our glory, <em>which none of the Rulers of this world knoweth</em>.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c013'><sup>[82]</sup></a> “Now the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness
unto him; and he cannot know them because they are spiritually examined.

  <h3 class='c018'>AN INFANT GENIUS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The idea of re-incarnation, that is to say of a succession of earth-lives
passed through by each individual monad, seems so new
and so daring to the Western World, that we are always being
asked, “Where are your proofs? Are we to take such a startling hypothesis
as this simply on your <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipse dixit</i></span>, or on the authority of some
ancient Oriental book or <a id='corr296.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“problematical”'>‘problematical’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_296.7'><ins class='correction' title='“problematical”'>‘problematical’</ins></a></span> Mahatma?”</p>

<p class='c028'>To such a question the reply cannot be given in two or three words;
for, while maintaining that there is at least as much reliance to be placed
upon the Sacred Books of the East as on those of any other religion,
and while holding firm to the belief that there <em>are</em> beings of a higher
order of intelligence living upon this earth, and mixing even in its
great life-currents, we cannot expect that merely because we say
“Man does not leave this earth for good and all at Death,” we therefore
shall gain credence. Before the world of Science our position
would have to be that of a Young with his undulatory hypothesis of
light, or a Dalton with his atomic theory. We cannot bring proof
positive to those who desire an Euclidic demonstration; we can only
offer to them a hypothesis, and bid them treat it calmly and dispassionately,
not flying straightway into a fury of abuse at our great impudence in
daring to suggest a heresy, but weighing it with care, and trying whether
or no it will explain some of the dark riddles of existence.</p>

<p class='c028'>To ourselves, merely as a working hypothesis, the doctrine of reincarnation
seems to throw so much long-sought-for light upon the bewildering
enigmas of life, and the strange vagaries of a fickle fortune,
that we could not, even if we would, lay aside so fluent an interpreter of
the utterances of the Sphinx—Existence. The seeming injustices in
the lot of man fall into line as units of the great battalion of cause and
effect; “What a man sows that must he also reap.” How else account
for all the misery that cries aloud on every hand, the starving multitudes,
the good man persecuted, the charlatan triumphant? In the small
purview of a life summed up in three-score years and ten, where is the
indication of a Divine intelligence that metes to each his due?</p>

<p class='c028'>But if this brief existence be not the only one that man incarnate
must pass through, if it be, as we are assured, but one short link in a
chain that spans a fathomless expanse of myriad years, then does the
eternity of justice proclaim itself, handed on from birth to birth in the
dark fuel of the torch of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>Our purpose now, however, is not to strive to catalogue the countless
instances where destiny appears to cry aloud, into the deaf ears of man,
that life is fraught with dire responsibility for future life, but to point to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>a case where she, in kindlier mood, has shown the gracious aspect of her
face.</p>

<p class='c028'>For the last few months London has been taken by storm by the
marvellous musical talent of a child whose life, in this incarnation at
least, is barely ten years old. We allude, of course, to Josef Hofmann.
None of our readers who have heard this boy but must have wondered
whence this phenomenal skill could have been derived. Other children
have come before the public, and roused its listlessness a little with
exhibitions of infantile precocity. But this young Josef has taken at
once front rank among the stars of the musical world, and won a place
only to be compared to that of the fairy-child Mozart.</p>

<p class='c028'>Whence comes this breadth of feeling, this grasp of musical
expression? It is certain that it comes not from his teacher; for
his father alone has filled that capacity, and it does not show itself
in <em>his</em> performance; and again, the only unsatisfactory part of the boy’s
playing is clearly the result of mannerisms such as the second-rate
conductor of a provincial orchestra would, without fail, extol and
inculcate. No; it is clear that the swing of rhythm, the determination of
attack, the delicacy of sentiment, must come from a man’s heart beating
within that boyish frame, and a man’s mind shining through that childish
head. Could one forget the name of the performer for one instant, and
shut from one’s eyes his physical presence, it were a <em>man</em> that was revealing
to us the secrets of the notes. The rife experience of years must
needs precede such rendering of musical thought; an experience earned in
many a fight with varying fortune, in sympathy with many a tale of woe,
in rejoicing over many a glimpse of Love and Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c028'>Yet ten short years are all his tale! What magician could crowd into
that tiny space the parti-coloured pictures of a fevered life of energy?
No, it must be that the child has lived upon this earth before, has borne
his lance in the thickest of the fray, has achieved distinction in some
great branch of art and garnered up a store of thought and feeling, into
the inheritance of which his heir, himself, has entered. He may
squander it again; alas, so many have before; but there it is, for him
to use aright or wrongly, and serious is the charge imposed upon his
guardians that they shall lay the lesson to heart that to whom much is
given, from him shall much be expected. But with that aspect of the
case it is not for us here to deal. We have only adduced this boy’s
genius as one of the indications that life is in its succession a far more
complex problem than the materialists or the orthodox religionists
would lead us to believe. There are countless other suggestive little
facts of early talent that must have come within the circle of the daily
life of each of us; but without the thread of Karma whereon to string
them, we pass them by; and it is only when some remarkable
phenomenon, such as that of Josef Hofmann, bursts upon the world,
that men fall to wondering. Yet it is by the accumulation of small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>details that a philosopher like Darwin worked out his scheme of natural
evolution; and it is by the testing of such a theory as that of re-incarnation
by many a little hitherto unexplained incident that we shall find
its worth. Nor is it merely as a curious prying into mysteries that we
should regard such research; for, once let a man convince himself that
though “Art is long,” yet Life, in its recurrence, is longer, he will find
in the thought that he is really laying up treasure in heaven (the <em>lives</em>
to come), encouragement, despite all temporary failure, to do whatsoever
his hand findeth to do with all his might.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>II.</h4>

<p class='c035'>The word Chréstos existed ages before Christianity was heard of. It is
found used, from the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, by Herodotus, by Æschylus and
other classical Greek writers, the meaning of it being applied to both
things and persons.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus in Æschylus (Cho. 901) we read of Μαντεύματα πυθόχρηστα (<em>pythochrésta</em>)
the “oracles delivered by a Pythian God” (<cite>Greek-Eng. Lex.</cite>)
through a pythoness; and <em>Pythochréstos</em> is the nominative singular of an adjective
derived from <em>chrao</em> χράω (Eurip. <cite>Ion</cite>, 1, 218). The later meanings coined freely
from this primitive application, are numerous and varied. Pagan classics
expressed more than one idea by the verb χράομαι “consulting an oracle”;
for it also means “fated,” <em>doomed</em> by an oracle, in the sense of a <em>sacrificial victim
to its decree</em>, or—“to the <span class='sc'>Word</span>”; as <em>chrésterion</em> is not only “the seat of an
oracle” but also “an offering to, or for, the oracle.”<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c013'><sup>[83]</sup></a> <em>Chrestés</em> χρήστης is
one who expounds or explains oracles, “a <em>prophet</em>, a <em>soothsayer</em>;”<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c013'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and
<em>chrésterios</em> χρηστὴριος is one who belongs to, or is in the service of, an
oracle, a god, or a “Master”;<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c013'><sup>[85]</sup></a> this Canon Farrar’s efforts notwithstanding.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c013'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>All this is evidence that the terms Christ and Christians, spelt originally
<em>Chrést</em> and <em>Chréstians</em> χρηστιανοὶ<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c013'><sup>[87]</sup></a> were directly borrowed from the Temple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>terminology of the Pagans, and meant the same thing. The God of the Jews
was now substituted for the Oracle and the other gods; the generic designation
“Chréstos” became a noun applied to one special personage; and new terms
such as <em>Chréstianoï</em> and <em>Chréstodoulos</em> “a follower or servant of Chrestos”—were
coined out of the old material. This is shown by Philo Judæus, a
monotheist, assuredly, using already the same term for monotheistic purposes.
For he speaks of θεόχρηστος (<em>théochréstos</em>) “God-declared,” or one who is
declared by god, and of λόγια θεόχρηστα (<em>logia théochrésta</em>) “sayings delivered
by God”—which proves that he wrote at a time (between the first century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and the first <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) when neither Christians nor Chrestians were yet
known under these names, but still called themselves the Nazarenes. The
notable difference between the two words χράω—“consulting or obtaining response
from a god or oracle” (χρεω being the Ionic earlier form of it), and χριω
(<em>chrio</em>) “to rub, to anoint” (from which the name Christos), have not prevented
the ecclesiastical adoption and coinage from Philo’s expression θεόχρηστος
of that other term θεόχριστος “anointed by God.” Thus the quiet substitution
of the letter ι for η for dogmatic purposes, was achieved in the easiest
way, as we now see.</p>

<p class='c028'>The secular meaning of <em>Chréstos</em> runs throughout the classical Greek literature
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pari passu</i></span> with that given to it in the mysteries. Demosthenes’ saying
ω χρηστέ  (330, 27), means by it simply “you nice fellow”; Plato (in Phaed.
264 B) has χρηστός ει ὅτι ἣγεῖ—“you are an excellent fellow to think....” But
in the esoteric phraseology of the temples “chrestos,”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c013'><sup>[88]</sup></a> a word which, like the
participle <em>chréstheis</em>, is formed under the same rule, and conveys the same
sense—from the verb χράομαι(“to consult a god”)—answers to what we
would call an adept, also a high <em>chela</em>, a disciple. It is in this sense that it is
used by Euripides (Ion. 1320) and by Æschylus (1 <span class='fss'>C</span>). This qualification was
applied to those whom the god, oracle, or any superior had proclaimed this, that,
or anything else. An instance may be given in this case.</p>

<p class='c028'>The words χρῆσεν οικιστῆρα used by Pindar (p. 4-10) mean “the oracle
<em>proclaimed</em> him the coloniser.” In this case the genius of the Greek language
permits that the man so proclaimed should be called χρήστος (<em>Chréstos</em>).
Hence this term was applied to every Disciple recognised by a Master, as also
to every good man. Now, the Greek language affords strange etymologies.
Christian theology has chosen and decreed that the name Christos should be
taken as derived from χρίΩ, χρίσω (Chriso), “anointed with scented unguents
or oil.” But this word has several significances. It is used by Homer,
certainly, as applied to the rubbing with oil of the body after bathing (<cite>Il.</cite> 23,
186; also in <cite>Od.</cite> 4, 252) as other ancient writers do. Yet the word χρίστης
(<em>Christes</em>) means rather a <em>white-washer</em>, while the word Chrestes (χρήστης)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>means priest and prophet, a term far more applicable to Jesus, than that of the
“Anointed,” since, as Nork shows on the authority of the Gospels, he never
was anointed, either as king or priest. In short, there is a deep mystery underlying
all this scheme, which, as I maintain, only a thorough knowledge of the
Pagan mysteries is capable of unveiling.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c013'><sup>[89]</sup></a> It is not what the early Fathers,
who had an object to achieve, may affirm or deny, that is the important point,
but rather what is now the evidence for the real significance given to the two
terms <em>Chréstos</em> and <em>Christos</em> by the ancients in the pre-Christian ages. For
the latter had no object to achieve, therefore nothing to conceal or disfigure,
and their evidence is naturally the more reliable of the two. This evidence
can be obtained by first studying the meaning given to these words by the
classics, and then their correct significance searched for in mystic symbology.</p>

<p class='c028'>Now <em>Chrestos</em>, as already said, is a term applied in various senses. It qualifies
both Deity and Man. It is used in the former sense in the Gospels, and in
Luke (vi., 35), where it means “kind,” and “merciful.” <a id='corr301.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='χρηστός'>“χρηστός</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_301.15'><ins class='correction' title='χρηστός'>“χρηστός</ins></a></span> ἑστιν
επι τους,” in 1 Peter (ii, 3), where it is said, “Kind is the Lord,” χρηστός
ὁ κύριος. On the other hand, it is explained by Clemens Alexandrinus
as simply meaning a good man; <i>i.e.</i> “All who believe in <em>Chrést</em> (a good
man) both <em>are</em>, and <em>are called Chréstians</em>, that is good men.” (Strom. lib. ii.)
The reticence of Clemens, whose Christianity, as King truly remarks in his
“<em>Gnostics</em>,” was no more than a graft upon the congenial stock of his original
Platonism, is quite natural. He was an Initiate, a new Platonist, before he became a
Christian, which fact, however much he may have fallen off from his earlier views,
could not exonerate him from his pledge of secrecy. And as a Theosophist and a
<em>Gnostic</em>, one who <em>knew</em>, Clemens must have known that <em>Christos</em> was “the <span class='fss'>WAY</span>,”
while <em>Chréstos</em> was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal
through that “Path,” which goal was <em>Christos</em>, the glorified Spirit of “<span class='sc'>Truth</span>,”
the reunion with which makes the soul (the Son) <span class='fss'>ONE</span> with the (Father) Spirit.
That Paul knew it, is certain, for his own expressions prove it. For what do
the words πάλιν ὠδίνω, ἅχρις οὕ μορφωθῆ χριστὸς ἐνὺμῖν, or, as given in the
authorised translations, “I am again in travail until <em>Christ be formed in you</em>”
mean, but what we give in its esoteric rendering, <i>i.e.</i> “until you find <em>the</em> Christos
within yourselves as your only ‘way.’” (<i>vide</i> Galatians iv., 19 and 20.)</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus Jesus, whether of Nazareth or Lüd,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c013'><sup>[90]</sup></a> was a Chréstos, as undeniably as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>that he never was entitled to the appellation of <em>Christos</em>, during his life-time and
before his last trial. It may have been as Higgins thinks, who surmises that
the first name of Jesus was, perhaps, χρεισος  the second χρησος, and the third
χρισος. “The word χρεισος was in use before the H (cap. <em>eta</em>) was in the
language.” But Taylor (in his answer to Pye Smith, p. 113) is quoted saying
“The complimentary epithet Chrest ... signified nothing more than a
good man.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Here again a number of ancient writers may be brought forward to testify that
<em>Christos</em> (or <em>Chreistos</em>, rather) was, along with χρησος = Hrésos, an adjective
applied to Gentiles before the Christian era. In <cite>Philopatris</cite> it is said ει τυχοι
χρηστος και εν εθνεσιν, <i>i.e.</i> “if chrestos chance to be even among the Gentiles,”
etc.</p>

<p class='c028'>Tertullian denounces in the 3rd chapter of his <cite>Apologia</cite> the word “<em>Christianus</em>”
as derived by “crafty interpretation;”<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c013'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Dr. Jones, on the other hand,
letting out the information, corroborated by good sources, that <em>Hrésos</em>
χρησός was the name given to Christ by the Gnostics, and even by <a id='corr302.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>unbelievers,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_302.16'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>unbelievers,”</ins></a></span>
assures us that the real name ought to be χρισος or Chrisos—thus
repeating and supporting the original “pious fraud” of the early Fathers, a
fraud which led to the carnalizing of the whole Christian system.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c013'><sup>[92]</sup></a> But I propose
to show as much of the real meaning of all these terms as lies within my
humble powers and knowledge. Christos, or the “Christ-condition,” was ever
the synonym of the “Mahatmic-condition,” <i>i.e.</i>, the union of the man with the
divine principle in him. As Paul says (Ephes. iii. 17) “κατοικησαι τον χριστον
δια της πιστεως εν ταις καρδιαις ὑμωι.” “That you may find Christos in
your <em>inner</em> man through <em>knowledge</em>” not faith, as translated; for <em>Pistis</em> is “knowledge,”
as will be shown further on.</p>

<p class='c028'>There is still another and far more weighty proof that the name <em>Christos</em> is
pre-Christian. The evidence for it is found in the prophecy of the Erythrean
Sybil. We read in it ἹΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΕΙΣΤΟΣΘΕΟΝ ὙΙΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ ΣΤΑΥΡΟΣ. Read
esoterically, this string of meaningless detached nouns, which has no
sense to the profane, contains a real prophecy—only not referring to
Jesus—and a verse from the mystic catechism of the Initiate. The
prophecy relates to the coming down upon the Earth of the Spirit of
Truth (Christos), after which advent—that has once more nought to do with
Jesus—will begin the Golden Age; the verse refers to the necessity before
reaching that blessed condition of inner (or subjective) theophany and theopneusty,
to pass through the crucifixion of flesh or matter. Read exoterically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the words “<em>Iesous Chreistos theou yios soter stauros</em>,” meaning literally “Iesus,
Christos, God, Son, Saviour, Cross,” are most excellent handles to hang a Christian
prophecy on, but they are <em>pagan</em>, not Christian.</p>

<p class='c028'>If called upon to explain the names <span class='sc'>Iesous Chreistos</span>, the answer is: study
mythology, the so-called “fictions” of the ancients, and they will give you the
key. Ponder over Apollo, the solar god, and the “Healer,” and the allegory
about his son Janus (or Ion), his priest at Delphos, through whom alone could
prayers reach the immortal gods, and his other son Asclepios, called the <em>Soter</em>,
or Saviour. Here is a leaflet from esoteric history written in symbolical phraseology
by the old Grecian poets.</p>

<p class='c028'>The city of Chrisa<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c013'><sup>[93]</sup></a> (now spelt Crisa), was built in memory of Kreusa (or
Creusa), daughter of King Erechtheus and mother of Janus (or Ion) by Apollo,
in memory of the danger which Janus escaped.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c013'><sup>[94]</sup></a> We learn that Janus,
abandoned by his mother in a grotto “to hide the shame of the virgin who bore
a son,” was found by Hermes, who brought the infant to Delphi, nurtured him
by his father’s sanctuary and oracle, where, under the name of Chresis (χρησις)
Janus became first a <em>Chrestis</em> (a priest, soothsayer, or Initiate), and then
very nearly a <em>Chresterion</em>, “a sacrificial victim,”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c013'><sup>[95]</sup></a> ready to be poisoned by his
own mother, who knew him not, and who, in her jealousy, mistook him, on the
hazy intimation of the oracle, for a son of her husband. He pursued her to the
very altar with the intention of killing her—when she was saved through the
pythoness, who divulged to both the secret of their relationship. In memory
of this narrow escape, Creusa, the mother, built the city of Chrisa, or Krisa.
Such is the allegory, and it symbolizes simply the trials of Initiation.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c013'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Finding then that Janus, the solar God, and son of Apollo, the Sun, means
the “Initiator” and the “Opener of the Gate of Light,” or secret wisdom of
the mysteries; that he is born from Krisa (esoterically <em>Chris</em>), and that he was
a <em>Chrestos</em> through whom spoke the God; that he was finally Ion, the father of
the Ionians, and, some say, an <em>aspect</em> of Asclepios, another son of Apollo, it is
easy to get hold of the thread of Ariadne in this labyrinth of allegories. It is
not the place here to prove side issues in mythology, however. It suffices to
show the connection between the mythical characters of hoary antiquity and
the later fables that marked the beginning of our era of civilization. Asclepios
(Esculapius) was the divine physician, the “Healer,” the “Saviour,” Σωτηρ
as he was called, a title also given to Janus of Delphi; and IASO, the daughter of
Asclepios was the goddess of healing, under whose patronage were all the candidates
for initiation in her father’s temple, the novices or <em>chrestoi</em>, called “the
sons of Iaso.” (<i>Vide</i> for name, “Plutus,” by Aristoph. 701).</p>

<p class='c028'>Now, if we remember, firstly, that the names of <span class='sc'>Iesus</span> in their different
forms, such as Iasius, Iasion, Jason and Iasus, were very common in ancient
Greece, especially among the descendants of Jasius (the Jasides), as also the
number of the “sons of Iaso,” the <em>Mystoï</em> and future Epoptai (Initiates), why
should not the enigmatical words in the Sibylline Book be read in their legitimate
light, one that had nought to do with a Christian prophecy? The secret
doctrine teaches that the first two words ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΧΡΕΙΣΤΟΣ mean simply
“son of Iaso, a Chrestos,” or servant of the oracular God. Indeed IASO
(Ιασω) <em>is in the Ionic dialect IESO</em> (Ἱησὼ), and the expression Ιησους
(<em>Iesous</em>)—in its archaic form, ΙΗΣΟΥΣ—simply means “the son of Iaso or
<em>Ieso</em>, the <a id='corr304.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“healer'>healer</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_304.25'><ins class='correction' title='“healer'>healer</ins></a></span>,” <i>i.e.</i> ο Ιησοῦς (υῖος). No objection, assuredly, can be
taken to such rendering, or to the name being written <em>Ieso</em> instead of <em>Iaso</em>, since
the first form is <em>attic</em>, therefore incorrect, for the name is <em>Ionic</em>. “Ieso” from
which “O’ Iesous” (son of Ieso)—<i>i.e.</i> a genitive, not a nominative—<em>is Ionic
and cannot</em> be anything else, if the age of the Sibylline book is taken into consideration.
Nor could the Sibyl of Erythrea have spelt it originally otherwise,
as Erythrea, her very residence, was a town in Ionia (from Ion or Janus)
opposite Chios; and that the <em>Ionic</em> preceded the <em>attic</em> form.</p>

<p class='c028'>Leaving aside in this case the mystical signification of the now famous Sibylline
sentence, and giving its literal interpretation only, on the authority of all that
has been said, the hitherto mysterious words would stand; “Son of <span class='sc'>Iaso,
Chrestos</span> (the priest or servant) (of the) <span class='sc'>Son</span> of (the) <span class='sc'>God</span> (Apollo) the
<span class='sc'>Saviour</span> from the <span class='sc'>Cross</span>”—(of flesh or matter).<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c013'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Truly, Christianity can never
hope to be understood until every trace of dogmatism is swept away from it,
and the dead letter sacrificed to the eternal Spirit of Truth, which is Horus,
which is Crishna, which is Buddha, as much as it is the Gnostic Christos and
the true Christ of Paul.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the <cite>Travels</cite> of Dr. Clarke, the author describes a heathen monument found
by him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Within the sanctuary, behind the altar, we saw the fragments of a <em>marble cathedra</em>, upon the
back of which we found the following inscription, exactly as it is here written, no part of it having
been injured or obliterated, affording perhaps the only instance known of a sepulchral inscription upon
a monument of this <a id='corr305.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='remakable'>remarkable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_305.4'><ins class='correction' title='remakable'>remarkable</ins></a></span> form.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The inscription ran thus: ΧΡΗΣΤΟΣ ΠΡΩΤΟΥ ΘΕΣΣΑΛΟΣ ΛΑΡΙΣΣΑΙΟΣ
ΠΕΛΑΣΓΙΟΤΗΣ ΕΤΩΝ ΙΗ or, “Chrestos, the first, a Thessalonian from
Larissa, Pelasgiot 18 years old Hero,” Chrestos the <em>first</em> (<em>protoo</em>), why?
Read literally the inscription has little sense; interpreted esoterically, it is
pregnant with meaning. As Dr. Clarke shows, the word Chrestos is found on
the epitaphs of almost all the ancient Larissians; but it is preceded always by
a proper name. Had the adjective Chrestos stood after a name, it would only
mean “a good man,” a posthumous compliment paid to the defunct, the same
being often found on our own modern tumular epitaphs. But the word
Chrestos, standing alone and the other word, “protoo,” following it, gives it
quite another meaning, especially when the deceased is specified as a “hero.”
To the mind of an Occultist, the defunct was a neophyte, who had died in his
18th year <em>of neophytism</em>,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c013'><sup>[98]</sup></a> and stood in the first or highest class of discipleship,
having passed his preliminary trials as a “hero;” but had died before the last
mystery, which would have made of him a “Christos,” an <em>anointed</em>, one with the
spirit of Christos or Truth in him. He had not reached the end of the “Way,”
though he had heroically conquered the horrors of the preliminary theurgic trials.</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='badquotes7'></a>We are quite warranted in reading it in this manner, after learning the place
where Dr. Clarke discovered the tablet, which was, as Godfrey Higgins remarks,
there, where “I should expect to find it, at Delphi, in the temple of the God
IE.,” who, with the Christians became Jah, or Jehovah, one with Christ Jesus.
It was at the foot of Parnassus, in a gymnasium, “adjoining the Castalian fountain,
which flowed by the ruins of Crisa, probably the town called Crestona,” etc.
And again. “In the first part of its course from the (Castalian) fountain, it (the
river) separates the remains of the gymnasium ... from the valley of Castro,”
as it probably did from the old city of Delphi—the seat of the great oracle of
Apollo, of the town of Krisa (or Kreusa) the great centre of initiations and of the
<em>Chrestoi</em> of the decrees of the oracles, where the candidates for the last <em>labour</em>
were anointed with sacred oils<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c013'><sup>[99]</sup></a> before being plunged into their last trance of
forty-nine hours’ duration (as to this day, in the East), from which they arose
as glorified adepts or <em>Christoi</em>.”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“In the Clementine Recognitions it is announced that the father anointed his son with <a id='corr305.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“oil'>‘oil</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_305.36'><ins class='correction' title='“oil'>‘oil</ins></a></span> that

the Christian name. This again is Egyptian. Horus was the anointed son of the father. The mode
of anointing him from the Tree of Life, portrayed on the monuments, is very primitive indeed; and
the Horus of Egypt was continued in the Gnostic Christ, who is reproduced upon the Gnostic stones
as the intermediate link betwixt the <em>Karest</em> and the Christ, also as the Horus of both <a id='corr305.41'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sexes.'>sexes.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_305.41'><ins class='correction' title='sexes.'>sexes.”</ins></a></span> (“<em>The

</div>

<p class='c028'>Mr. G. Massey connects the Greek Christos or Christ with the Egyptian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span><em>Karest</em>, the “mummy type of immortality,” and proves it very thoroughly. He
begins by saying that in Egyptian the “Word of Truth” is <em>Ma-Kheru</em>, and that
it is the title of Horus. Thus, as he shows, Horus preceded Christ as the
Messenger of the Word of Truth, the Logos or the manifestor of the divine
nature in humanity. In the same paper he writes as follows:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>The Gnosis had three phases—astronomical, spiritual, and doctrinal, and all three can be
identified with the Christ of Egypt. In the astronomical phase the constellation Orion is called the
<em>Sahu</em> or <em>mummy</em>. The soul of Horus was represented as rising from the dead and ascending to
heaven in the stars of Orion. The mummy-image was the preserved one, the saved, therefore a
portrait of the Saviour, as a type of immortality. This was the figure of a dead man, which, as
Plutarch and Herodotus tell us, was carried round at an Egyptian banquet, when the guests were
invited to look on it and eat and drink and be happy, because, when they died, they would become
what the image symbolised—that is, they also would be immortal! This type of immortality was
called the <em>Karest</em>, or <em>Karust</em>, and it <em>was</em> the Egyptian Christ. To <em>Kares</em> means to embalm, anoint,
to make the Mummy as a type of the eternal; and, when made, it was called the <em>Karest</em>; so that
this is not merely a matter of name for name, the <em>Karest</em> for the <em>Christ</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>This image of the <em>Karest</em> was bound up in a woof without a seam, the proper vesture of the Christ!
No matter what the length of the bandage might be, and some of the mummy-swathes have been
unwound that were 1,000 yards in length, the woof was from beginning to end without a seam....
Now, this seamless robe of the Egyptian <em>Karest</em> is a very tell-tale type of the mystical Christ, who
becomes historic in the Gospels as the wearer of a coat or chiton, made without a seam, which neither
the Greek nor the Hebrew fully explains, but which is explained by the Egyptian <em>Ketu</em> for the woof,
and by the seamless robe or swathing without seam that was made for eternal wear, and worn by the
Mummy-Christ, the image of immortality in the tombs of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c028'>Further, Jesus is put to death in accordance with the instructions given for making the <em>Karest</em>.
Not a bone must be broken. The true <em>Karest</em> must be perfect in every member. “This is he who
comes out sound; whom men know not is his name.”</p>

<p class='c028'>In the Gospels Jesus rises again with every member sound, like the perfectly-preserved <em>Karest</em>, to
demonstrate the physical resurrection of the mummy. But, in the Egyptian original, the mummy
transforms. The deceased says: “I am spiritualised. I am become a soul. I rise as a God.”
This transformation into the spiritual image, the <em>Ka</em>, has been omitted in the Gospel.</p>

<p class='c028'>This spelling of the name as Chrest or Chrést in Latin is supremely important, because it
enables me to prove the identity with the Egyptian <em>Karest</em> or <em>Karust</em>, the name of the Christ as the
<a id='corr306.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='enbalmed'>embalmed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_306.34'><ins class='correction' title='enbalmed'>embalmed</ins></a></span> mummy, which was the image of the resurrection in Egyptian tombs, the type of immortality,
the likeness of the Horus, who rose again and made the pathway out of the sepulchre for
those who were his disciples or followers. <em>Moreover, this type of the Karest or Mummy-Christ is
reproduced in the Catacombs of Rome.</em> No representation of the supposed historic resurrection of
Jesus has been found on any of the early Christian monuments. But, instead of the missing fact, we
find the scene of Lazarus being raised from the dead. This is depicted over and over again as the
typical resurrection where there is no real one! The scene is not exactly in accordance with the rising
from the grave in the Gospel. It is purely Egyptian, and Lazarus is an Egyptian mummy! Thus
Lazarus, in each representation, <em>is</em> the mummy-type of the resurrection; Lazarus <em>is</em> the Karest, who
was the Egyptian Christ, and who is reproduced by Gnostic art in the Catacombs of Rome as a form
of the Gnostic Christ, who <em>was not and could not become an historical character</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Further, as the thing is Egyptian, it is probable that the name is derived from Egyptian. If so,
Laz (equal to Ras) means to be raised up, while <em>aru is</em> the mummy by name. With the Greek
<a id='corr306.47'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='erminal'>terminal</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_306.47'><ins class='correction' title='erminal'>terminal</ins></a></span> <em>s</em> this becomes Lazarus. In the course of humanising the mythos the typical representation
of the resurrection found in the tombs of Rome and Egypt would become the story of Lazarus being
raised from the dead. This Karast type of the Christ in the Catacombs is not limited to
Lazarus.</p>

<p class='c028'>By means of the <em>Karest</em> type the Christ and the Christians can both be traced in the ancient
tombs of Egypt. The mummy was made in this likeness of the Christ. It was the Christ by name,
identical with the <em>Chrestoi</em> of the Greek Inscriptions. Thus the honoured dead, who rose again as the
followers of Horus-Makheru, the Word of Truth, are found to be the Christians οι χρηστοι, on
the Egyptian monuments. <em>Ma-Kheru</em> is the term that is always applied to the faithful ones who win
the crown of life and wear it at the festival which is designated ‘Come thou to me’—an invitation
by Horus the Justifier to those who are the ‘Blessed ones of his father, Osiris’—they who, having
made the Word of Truth the law of their lives, were the Justified—οι χρηστοι, the Christians,
on earth.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>In a fifth century representation of the Madonna and child from the cemetery of St. Valentinus,
the new-born babe lying in a box or crib <em>is</em> also the <em>Karest</em>, or mummy-type, further identified as the
divine babe of the solar mythos by the disk of the sun and the cross of the equinox at the back of
the infant’s head. Thus the child-Christ of the historic faith is born, and visibly begins in the <em>Karest</em>
image of the dead Christ, which was the mummy-type of the resurrection in Egypt for thousands of
years before the Christian era. This doubles the proof that the Christ of the Christian Catacombs
was a survival of the <em>Karest</em> of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c028'>Moreover, as Didron shows, there was a portrait of the Christ who had his body <em>painted red</em>!<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c013'><sup>[100]</sup></a>
It was a popular tradition that the Christ <em>was</em> of a red complexion. This, too, may be explained as
a survival of the Mummy-Christ. It was an aboriginal mode of rendering things <em>tapu</em> by colouring
them red. The dead corpse was coated with red ochre—a very primitive mode of making the
mummy, or the anointed one. Thus the God Ptah tells Rameses II. that he has “<em>re-fashioned his
flesh in vermilion</em>.” This anointing with red ochre is called <em>Kura</em> by the Maori, who likewise made
the Karest or Christ.</p>

<p class='c028'>We see the mummy-image continued on another line of descent when we learn that among other
pernicious heresies and deadly sins with which the Knights Templars were charged, was the impious
custom of adoring a Mummy that had red eyes. Their Idol, called Baphomet, is also thought to
have been a mummy.... The Mummy was the earliest human image of the Christ.</p>

<p class='c028'>I do not doubt that the ancient Roman festivals called the <em>Charistia</em> were connected in their
origin with the <em>Karest</em> and the <em>Eucharist</em> as a celebration in honour of the manes of their departed
kith and kin, for whose sakes they became reconciled at the friendly gathering once a year....
It is here, then, we have to seek the essential connection between the Egyptian Christ, the
Christians, and the Roman Catacombs. These Christian Mysteries, ignorantly explained to be
inexplicable, can be explained by Gnosticism and Mythology, but in no other way. It is not that
they are insoluble by human reason, as their incompetent, howsoever highly paid, expounders now-a-days
pretend. That is but the puerile apology of the unqualified for their own helpless ignorance—they
who have never been in possession of the gnosis or science of the Mysteries by which alone these
things can be explained in accordance with their natural genesis. In Egypt only can we read the
matter to the root, or identify the origin of the Christ by nature and by name, to find at last that the
Christ was the Mummy-type, and that our Christology is mummified <a id='corr307.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mythology.”'>mythology.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_307.30'><ins class='correction' title='mythology.”'>mythology.</ins></a></span>—(<cite>Agnostic Annual.</cite>)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The above is an explanation on purely scientific evidence, but, perhaps, a
little too <em>materialistic</em>, just because of that science, notwithstanding that the
author is a well-known Spiritualist. Occultism pure and simple finds the same
mystic elements in the Christian as in other faiths, though it rejects as
emphatically its dogmatic and <em>historic</em> character. It is a fact that in the terms
Ιησοῦς ὁ χριστος  (See <cite>Acts</cite> v. 42, ix. 14; 1 Corinth. iii. 17, etc.), the
article ὁ designating “Christos,” proves it simply a surname, like that of
Phocion, who is referred to as Φωκίων ὁ χρηστός (Plut. v.). Still, the
personage (Jesus) so addressed—whenever he lived—was a great Initiate and a
“Son of God.”</p>

<p class='c028'>For, we say it again, the surname Christos is based on, and the story of the
Crucifixion derived from, events that preceded it. Everywhere, in India as in
Egypt, in Chaldea as in Greece, all these legends were built upon one and the
same primitive type; the voluntary sacrifice of the <em>logoï</em>—the <em>rays</em> of the one
<span class='sc'>Logos</span>, the direct manifested emanation from the One ever-concealed Infinite
and Unknown—whose <em>rays</em> incarnated in mankind. They consented to <em>fall into
matter</em>, and are, therefore, called the “Fallen Ones.” This is one of those
great mysteries which can hardly be touched upon in a magazine article, but
shall be noticed in a separate work of mine, <em>The Secret Doctrine</em>, very fully.</p>

<p class='c028'>Having said so much, a few more facts may be added to the etymology of
the two terms. Χριστος being the verbal adjective in Greek of χρίω “to be rubbed
on,” <em>as ointment</em> or salve, and the word being finally brought to mean “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Anointed One,” in Christian theology; and <em>Kri</em>, in Sanskrit, the first syllable
in the name of Krishna, meaning “to pour out, or rub over, to cover with,”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c013'><sup>[101]</sup></a>
among many other things, this may lead one as easily to make of Krishna, “the
anointed one.” Christian philologists try to limit the meaning of Krishna’s
name to its derivation from <em>Krish</em>, “black”; but if the analogy and comparison
of the Sanskrit with the Greek roots contained in the names of Chrestos,
Christos, and <em>Ch</em>rishna, are analyzed more carefully, it will be found that they
are all of the same origin.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c013'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>“In Bockh’s ‘Christian Inscriptions,’ numbering 1,287, there is no single
instance of an earlier date than the third century, wherein the name is not
written <em>Chrest</em> or <em>Chreist</em>.” (<cite>The Name and Nature of the Christ</cite>, by G. Massey,
“The Agnostic Annual.”)</p>

<p class='c028'>Yet none of these names can be unriddled, as some Orientalists imagine,
merely with the help of astronomy and the knowledge of zodiacal signs in conjunction
with phallic symbols. Because, while the sidereal symbols of the mystic
characters or personifications in Puranâs or Bible, fulfil astronomical functions,
their spiritual anti-types rule invisibly, but very effectively, the world. They
exist as abstractions on the higher plane, as manifested ideas on the astral, and
become males, females and androgyne powers on this lower plane of ours.
<em>Scorpio</em>, as <em>Chrestos-Meshiac</em>, and Leo, as <em>Christos-Messiah</em> antedated by far
the Christian era in the trials and triumphs of Initiation during the Mysteries,
Scorpio standing as symbol for the latter, Leo for the glorified triumph of the
“sun” of truth. The mystic philosophy of the allegory is well understood by
the author of the “Source of Measures”; who writes: “One (Chrestos) causing
himself to go down into the pit (of Scorpio, or incarnation in the womb) for the
salvation of the world; this was the Sun, shorn of his <em>golden rays</em>, and <em>crowned
with blackened</em><a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c013'><sup>[103]</sup></a> <em>ones</em> (symbolizing this loss) as the thorns; <em>the other</em> was the
triumphant <em>Messiah</em>, mounted up to the <em>summit of the arch of heaven</em>, personated
as the <em>Lion of the tribe of Judah</em>. In both instances he had the Cross; once in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>humiliation (as the son of copulation), and once holding it in his control, as the
law of creation, he being Jehovah”—in the scheme of the authors of dogmatic
Christianity. For, as the same author shows further, John, Jesus and even
Apollonius of Tyana were but epitomizers of the history of the Sun “under
differences of aspect or condition.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c013'><sup>[104]</sup></a> The explanation, he says, “is simple
enough, when it is considered that the names <em>Jesus</em>, Hebrew יש and
Apollonius, or Apollo, are alike names of the <em>Sun in the heavens</em>, and, necessarily,
the history of the one, as to his travels through <em>the signs</em>, with the personifications
of his sufferings, triumphs and miracles, could be but the <em>history of the other</em>,
where there was a wide-spread, common method of describing those travels by
personification.” The fact that the Secular Church was founded by Constantine,
and that it was a part of his decree “that the venerable day of the <em>Sun</em> should
be the day set apart for the worship of Jesus Christ as <em>Sun</em>-day,” shows that
they knew well in that “Secular Church” “that the allegory rested upon an astronomical
basis,” as the author affirms. Yet, again, the circumstance that both
Purânas and Bible are full of solar and astronomical allegories, does not militate
against that other fact that all such scriptures in addition to these two are <em>closed</em>
books to the scholars “having authority.”(!) Nor does it affect that other truth,
that all those systems are <em>not the work of mortal man</em>, nor are they his invention
in their origin and basis.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus “Christos,” under whatever name, means more than <em>Karest</em>, a mummy,
or even the “anointed” and the <em>elect</em> of theology. Both of the latter apply to
<em>Chréstos</em>, the man of sorrow and tribulation, in his physical, mental, and
psychic conditions, and both relate to the Hebrew <em>Mashiac</em> (from whence
Messiah) condition, as the word is etymologised<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c013'><sup>[105]</sup></a> by Fuerst, and the author of
“The Source of Measures,” p. 255. Christos is the crown of glory of the
suffering Chréstos of the mysteries, as of the candidate to the final <span class='fss'>UNION</span>, of
whatever race and creed. To the true follower of the <span class='sc'>Spirit of Truth</span>, it
matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrestos, lived during the
era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived
and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages, and many were
the good and holy men in antiquity who bore the surname or title of Chrestos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>before Jesus of Nazareth, otherwise Jesus (or Jehoshua) Ben Pandira was born.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c013'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
Therefore, one may be permitted to conclude, with good reason, that Jesus,
or Jehoshua, was like Socrates, like Phocian, like Theodorus, and so many others
surnamed <em>Chréstos</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, the “good, the excellent,” the gentle, and the holy
Initiate, who showed the “way” to the Christos condition, and thus became
himself “the Way” in the hearts of his enthusiastic admirers. The Christians,
as all the “Hero-worshippers” have tried to throw into the background
all the other Chréstoï, who have appeared to them as rivals of <em>their</em> Man-God.
But if the voice of the <span class='sc'>Mysteries</span> has become silent for many ages in the West,
if Eleusis, Memphis, Antium, Delphi, and Crèsa have long ago been made the
tombs of a Science once as colossal in the West as it is yet in the East, there
are successors now being prepared for them. We are in 1887 and the
nineteenth century is close to its death. The twentieth century has strange
developments in store for humanity, and may even be the last of its name.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>A LAW OF LIFE: KARMA.</h4>

<p class='c035'>[The following letter has been received by the editors, in criticism on Mr.
Keightley’s article on “Karma”; and as it raises many rather important points, an
attempt has been made to answer them. Mr. Beatty’s letter is somewhat
difficult to deal with, for though it asks many questions, they are so inextricably
mingled with its author’s thoughts that it would be unfair to disentangle them
from the context. It is a pity that Mr. Beatty, in his haste to criticize, did not wait
for the conclusion of the article, as he might have saved himself some trouble.
If his real desire is to learn, it would be well that he should approach the
endeavour in a less flippant spirit and evolve the critic out of the criticaster.
In many of his arguments he has, so to say, “given himself away,” but, in the
interests of space and of the readers of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, only those questions and
arguments which bear directly on the points at issue have been selected for
answer. The point which Mr. Beatty does “not care to discuss,” and which
refers to the mystery of Godliness, has been omitted. Perhaps, if Mr. Beatty
continues to read, mark, learn, <em>and inwardly digest</em>, he may in some <em>future
incarnation</em> solve the mystery.]</p>

<p class='c035'>In an article in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, under the above heading, Mr. Keightley declares it
to be “very difficult, if not well-nigh impossible,” to understand Karma, and I
grant him that his essay is a practical demonstration of his allegation. The
difficulty (1.) does not, however, hinder him from attempting to define the
refractory term. “Karma,” he says, “is the working of the great law which governs
reincarnation,” or “a manifestation of the One, Universal, Divine Principle in
the phenomenal world,” or again, “the great law of harmony which governs the
universe.” Now, waiving altogether the question of reincarnations, I shall
proceed to examine whether Mr. Keightley makes good his contention that
“harmony,” in his sense of the word, “governs the Universe.” He says, “the
man who denies the existence of harmony in the universe has transgressed the
law and is experiencing punishment. He does this unconsciously to himself,
because the law of harmony forms an unconscious impulse to its readjustment
when it has been broken.” Here there are several things to be considered. In
the first place, it may be asked: (2.) Does a man, by merely denying the existence
of a law of Nature or the universe, <a id='corr311.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='trangress'>transgress</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_311.36'><ins class='correction' title='trangress'>transgress</ins></a></span> that law? I think not.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c013'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Secondly.
Can a law of the universe be “broken”? Here again I must reply in the
negative; for who is going to contend that the law of gravitation has ever been
“broken,”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c013'><sup>[108]</sup></a> has ever ceased to act, has ever required “re-adjustment”? A man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>can break no law of Nature in the sense of bringing that law into abeyance. If
then, a law of harmony governs the universe there can be no such thing as
discord. (3.) Yet Mr. Keightley admits that there <em>is</em> discord, that the law of
harmony has been “broken” and needs “readjustment” This is a surrendering
of his position and a patent admission that harmony is not constant or universal.
He then proceeds to draw an illustration from music. “In musical chords, the
composing notes, if taken by twos and threes, will be found in discord, but,
when taken together, produce a harmony.” This is a particularly unfortunate
subject of illustration. For does it not show that discord is an element in the
universe as well as harmony? Why are discords introduced into music? Simply
to make the harmony more effective. The reason for this, however, does not lie in
any so-called universal law of harmony, but rather in the constitution of animate
existences. Fundamentally, sensation is the consciousness of difference. Where
the difference is great the feeling is great. If we wish to have the keenest
sensation of sweetness we must first taste something bitter. Thus it is that
occasional discords heighten harmony. But are the discords any less real on
that account? Certainly not; for there can no more be harmony without
discord, than there can be an up without a down. This, moreover, is only another
illustration of the fact that human knowledge is merely relative. Must we,
however, admit that the universal law may be harmony while our experience
tells us that there are discords without number? Unless ignorance be considered
as superior to positive knowledge, I see no room for the admission. If a
man’s house tumbles about his ears, does it become any less a fact by trying to
persuade himself and his neighbours that it is still standing? This seems to be
the method of Mr. Keightley. He has, however, yet another argument “The
universe ... is essentially an evidence of harmony; otherwise it could not
exist, for it would fall to pieces.” This is a palpable begging of the question,
and, besides, very absurd. The universe is a harmony, because a universe must
be a harmony! “Otherwise it could not exist.” Now how does our harmonist
know whether it could exist or not? Of what other universe has he experience
or knowledge? “It would fall to pieces.” Where, I wonder, would it fall to?
Perhaps it is even now fast falling to pieces, and who can tell us differently?
As far as ordinary people can judge, it seems, as regards the parts we are
acquainted with, to be falling into more or less concrete masses, but not many
sane people believe it can fall into nothingness. After all this vain contention
for universal harmony we find Mr. Keightley settling down like ordinary mortals
to the conviction that the world is far from harmonious or perfect. One
unfortunate individual who cannot be persuaded that all is harmony, is told
that “he is incapable of understanding it because his attention is solely devoted
to that which produces discord.” How comes it that the universe does not fall
to pieces as a result of this discord? Surely we are in a precarious
condition, if every obstinate fool who persists in crying out when he has been
hurt, endangers the stability of the universe. Did ever anyone meet with a
universe where there is less evidence of harmony? One brute force ever in
conflict with another. Infernal forces piling up mountain on the top of
mountain; supernal forces blasting, rending, excoriating and tumbling these
mountains down again into the valleys; the oak struggling against the
inwarping ivy, the fawn attempting vainly to escape from the claws of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>tiger, the child agonising while <a id='corr313.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='parasities'>parasites</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_313.1'><ins class='correction' title='parasities'>parasites</ins></a></span> eat slowly and mercilessly into its
lungs, liver, or brain; the strong everywhere victorious over the weak; each sect
and each party exerting itself ferociously to scoop out the viscera of its rival.
Such is the world, such all records declare it to have been, and such it gives
ample promise of continuing. But if the world is not really so, and on the
contrary is one immensity of joyous harmony, who can tell us why the evidence
is so deceptive? Here again, Mr. Keightley introduces to us a most remarkable
statement. “The one Divine principle is divided by man’s actions into two
opposing forces of good and evil, and man’s progress depends on the exertion
of his will to preserve harmony and prevent deviation to one side or the other.”
Give us by all means in preference to this for common sense, for rationality and
for every other quality that makes it digestible, the childish story of Eve, the
apple and the fall.</p>

<p class='c028'>Beyond doubt, Mr. Keightley has a profound faith in man as a power in the
universe and an instrument for evil. By a most singular process of metaphysical
alchemy man decomposes the “Divine principle” into “two opposing forces of
good and evil.” It seems from this revised version of an old story that man
introduced evil into the universe. Why is man so important that a universe
should be polluted for his sake? Surely man did not make himself, and
whatever powers were in him for evil or for good must have been potential in
that from which he sprang. Man can create nothing, neither evil nor good,
neither a tendency to do right nor an inclination to do wrong. “Man’s will” is
always a tremendous force for good or evil in the hands of theologians and
metaphysicians. Did man make his own “will?” If not, how can he be
responsible for what he does? Everybody knows that man can act according to
his likes or dislikes. But does anybody imagine that he can make his own likes
or dislikes? (4.) He can do as he wishes, but he wishes according to his
nature, and this he cannot transcend, consequently he is not responsible to the
Author of his nature for what his nature inclines him to do. But what are we
to understand by the rest of the sentence? Man’s will is “to preserve harmony
and prevent deviation to one side or the other.” First the will brings about evil
in the “Divine principle,” destroying harmony, then it is to reproduce harmony
and at the same time to maintain a balance between good and evil, and “prevent
deviation to the one side or the other.” This to Mahatmas and possessors of
the “sixth sense” may seem plain logic, but it far surpasses my comprehension.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c013'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
I am, perhaps, as averse to “the pernicious doctrine of reward and punishment
after death, in heaven or in hell” as Mr. Keightley can be, but I can by no
means deduce from it the results which to him appear so inevitable.
“Nothing,” he says, “could have been found more calculated to circumscribe
the view of life as a whole, and concentrate man’s attention on temporary
matters.... He either rejected the idea of soul as altogether worthless, or else
he transferred his interest to the soul’s welfare in heaven—in either case
concentrating his attention on what is inevitably transient.” How the idea of
never-ending existence in heaven or in hell can have the effect of circumscribing
“the view of life as a whole,” and of concentrating “man’s attention on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>temporary matters,” is to me an insolvable puzzle. That it should have quite
the opposite effect, does not seem to require proof. Why, in the name of
mystery, should he “reject the idea of soul as worthless,” and how can
transferring “his interest to the soul’s welfare in heaven” be called a concentrating
of “his attention on what is inevitably transient?” Truly this
Karma is a bewildering subject!<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c013'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c035'>Do plants and animals come under the law of Karma? is the next question
discussed by Mr. Keightley. An extract from the <cite>Theosophist</cite> seems to
discountenance such a thing. But are its arguments really conclusive against
it? I do not think so. It says, “A piece of iron is attracted to a
magnet without having any desire in the matter.” Now, in the first place,
this is pure assumption, and has its origin in vainglorious human egotism.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c013'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
It is evident that from objective data alone we cannot decide what is the
subjective state of the molecules of the attracted iron. In the second place,
we are only acquainted with the iron as a cause producing changes in us.
No matter how we interpret these changes, they cannot even tell us the real
nature of iron, merely considered objectively. Again the extract proceeds:
“An animal usually follows the instincts of its nature without any merit or
demerit for so doing; a child or an idiot may smilingly kick over a lamp, which
may set a whole city on fire.... A person can only be held responsible according
to his ability to perceive justice, and to distinguish between good and
evil.” According to this doctrine, man is not an “animal,” and does not follow
his instincts. To those who are acquainted, even slightly, with the method and
regularity of Nature, this contention will appear, on the face of it, untenable.
For why should there be an exception in the case of man?<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c013'><sup>[112]</sup></a>  Has man instincts,
desires, and inclinations, or has he not? If he has, why should he have them
if he is not to follow them? And if in any case he does not follow them, is
it not with him as with the “animals”? Is it not because he is deterred by
influences from without, or hereditary influences from within? And of all these
instincts, desires and influences, how is he to know which to obey, to know
which is of Divine sanction? He has conscience, of course, but conscience is a
very variable quantity, and indeed, it might not be too much to say that there
is hardly a crime in the world that has not, at one time or another, been commended
by conscience. Conscience is only one phase of the man’s mental
activity, and was no more created by him than was his power of vision. We
talk of “children and idiots,” and their being irresponsible, but are not untamed
savages also irresponsible? And if we admit that there may be beings as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>higher than we, as we are higher than children, idiots, and savages, will they
not, with reason and justice, regard us as irresponsible? The truth is, there
never was a greater chimera conjured up by unreasoning fancy than that one of
man’s responsibility to a Supreme Power. Man is responsible only to man, and
man’s conduct is without merit except from a human view-point. We are good
or bad by reason of all the forces that act on and through us.</p>

<p class='c028'>My object in writing what I have written is to show to Theosophists the dense
darkness in which I wander. Will some God-illumined mind not take pity
upon, and draw me up from the labyrinthian gloom, where illusions mislead me
at every step? My “sixth sense” seems wholly dormant, and Nirvana, that
haven of rest, seems distant, by many a weary league of rocky path and burning
desert. Pity me.</p>

</div>

<p class='c035'>(1.) The difficulty experienced in fathoming the mysteries of Karmic Law
arises from the conditions of our present intellectual environment and general
evolutionary status. It has been, also, frequently stated that a <em>complete</em>
comprehension of its workings is reserved for the Initiate who has transcended
the domain of terrestrial activity—viz., the necessity for soul-evolution through
successive births. But, passing over this consideration, it is evident that, in
the process of bringing down fragments of the Divine Truth on to the plane of
mere intellectual interpretation, an inevitable distortion must ensue. The rays
of spiritual light will be split up and refracted as they pass through the prism
of the brain. Mr. Beatty will recognise this fact more clearly owing to his
belief “that <em>human</em> knowledge is <em>merely relative</em>.” Surely, when that most
familiar fact of our experience, the “perception of matter,” is, metaphysically
speaking, an illusion, the relativity of <em>mental</em> conceptions of spiritual truths
would appear to be a necessity. According to Huxley, Spencer, Du Bois
Reymond, and all leading thinkers, we know nothing of things as they are even
on this plane, which to the materialist is “All in all.” The essence of the
thing “perceived” escapes us; all we really grasp is its presentation in
consciousness. It is, therefore, clear that in interpreting realities on the superphysical
plane, we cannot advance beyond word-symbols and adumbrations.
The intuition of the individual must effect the rest.</p>

<p class='c028'>Such considerations, however, in no way militate against the successful
defence of Esoteric philosophy on purely intellectual lines. Translated into
terms of human thought, its metaphysics must be shown to blend intimately
with the <em>facts</em> of science and psychology, and its ability to solve the enigmas of
life demonstrated. “Philosophy is chaos,” remarks the author of “Absolute
Relativism,” referring to modern thought. If we are to avoid the spectacle of
a future “moral chaos,” also, as the fruit of the materialistic Upas tree, some
fresh impulse must be infused into the dry bones of Western metaphysics—some
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison  d’être</i></span> assigned to life, and an ideal worthy of man’s noblest efforts
presented to the multitude of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laissez-faire</i></span> pessimists. Such is an aspect of
the work now before us.</p>

<p class='c028'>(2.) A man may certainly injure himself<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c013'><sup>[113]</sup></a> by shutting his eyes to a spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>interpretation of the Universe and its workings. The only acquisition he
can carry with him after physical death is the <em>aroma</em> of the vast aggregate
of mental states generated in one incarnation. The <em>personality</em> or brain-consciousness
of the physical man is, after all, a mere feeler projected into
this objective plane to harvest experience for its individual Self. It does
not at all follow that any experience may be acquired which the Monad
is enabled to assimilate. Abstract thinking, religious aspirations, scientific
lore; poetry, the nobler emotions, and all such efflorescences of human
consciousness, furnish the “material” which go to build up the <em>transcendental
individuality</em> of the Ego progressing towards the Nirvana. The materialist
presents a frequent instance of soul-death—so far as the fruitage of the
personality is concerned. His knowledge may be enormous, but being unspiritualised,
a mere creature of the physical brain, it cannot blossom into
luxuriance in the Devachanic interim between successive births. Consequently,
as the True Self—the “transcendental subject” of the neo-Kantian German
school—only assimilates experience suitable to its own exalted nature, it becomes
evident that, ideals apart, the philosophy of a man is of very great importance.
At the same time, it need not be said that sectarian “religion” is almost more
pernicious than materialism, inasmuch as it combines the two factors of crass
ignorance and spiritual torpor.</p>

<p class='c028'>(3.) Harmony <em>is</em> essentially the law of the Universe. The contrasted aspects
of Nature come into being subsequently to the differentiation of matter from
its several <em>protyles</em> in the commencement of a cycle of becoming, or Manwantara,
and can have no reality except in the experience of conscious Egos.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c013'><sup>[114]</sup></a> For
beneath the surface of the great ocean of cosmic illusion—beneath the clash of
apparently clashing forces—lies the Eternal Harmony. The semblance of
discord is but a ripple on the stream of Maya, or illusion. One aspect of
esoteric solution of apparent evils is dealt with in the last issue of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>
(<i>vide</i> art., “Origin of Evil”). But Mr. Beatty will not find himself in a position
to accept its validity so long as he continues to “waive the question of reincarnation,”
the acceptance of that doctrine lying at the root of the real
explanation.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Universe must, at bottom, be a Harmony. Why?<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c013'><sup>[115]</sup></a> The equilibrating
action of the forces around us is a sufficient proof of the fact; the apparent
discord existing, as argued by Spinoza, solely in the sensations of conscious
beings. The matter in reality involves the re-opening of the much debated
question as to whether an optimistic or pessimistic pantheism is the creed of the
true philosopher. Can we with von Hartmann postulate the strange contradiction
of an absolutely wise (though from our standpoint unconscious) cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>behind phenomena confronted with a “worthless universe?” Obviously not.
Moreover, as pantheists necessarily regard the individual mind as only a
rushlight compared with the blazing sun of the Universal Mind, its source, how
is a final conclusion as to the “unfathomable folly” of manifested being
possible? On the other hand, a non-recognition of the Maya of appearances
is a tacit impeachment of the wisdom of the Absolute. The pantheist—and
pantheism alone accounts for consciousness itself—is, at least, logically driven
into the admission that the “nature of things” is sound and that, probably,
apparent flaws in the <a id='corr317.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>mechanicism</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_317.9'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>mechanicism</ins></a></span> of the Universe would, if viewed from a
wider standpoint than the human, altogether vanish.</p>

<p class='c028'>If, however, the Spinozistic axiom that evil <em>exists only in us</em>, is true—and
it is not for a relativist of our critic’s type to deny the fact—pessimism
is <a id='corr317.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='routed'>rooted</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_317.13'><ins class='correction' title='routed'>rooted</ins></a></span> in the recognition of the equilibrating action of the law of
Karma. The examples cited by Mr. Beatty of brute forces “one in
conflict with another;” of the sufferings of animals in the struggle
for existence; and more especially of human suffering in no way controvert
the views of the “Harmonists.” The first group is representative
of those forces which balance one another by oscillating about a common centre
of equilibrium, producing harmony by conflict, just as in the case of the so-called
centripetal and centrifugal forces, which regulate the earth’s orbital
journey. The second group is, undoubtedly, characterised by the infliction of
much incidental pain. But in all instances where Nature immolates the
individual organism on the altar of natural selection, she does it for the benefit
of the species or the “survival of the fittest”—the individuals borne down by
violence in the struggle, reaping, one and all, the results of a compensatory
Karma. In the domain of <em>human</em> suffering, moral debasement, etc., an
entirely new factor supervenes—the equilibrating influence of a <em>positive</em>
Karma, which in biblical language demands “an eye for an eye and a tooth for
a tooth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>(4). “Why,” asks our critic, “is man so important that the Universe was
polluted for his sake?” In the first place, Humanity is, by no means, unimportant;
the panorama of evolution only existing in order to evolve the Ego
from the animal stage up to that of a conscious God. The designation of
nature as divided into “good” and “evil” principles, has been taken by Mr.
Beatty in its absolute, as opposed to its relative, aspect. Man pollutes only himself
and his fellows by “sin”; nature remaining constant <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>. “How can he
be responsible for what he does?” he continues. He is only so within certain
wide limits defined by his previous Karma—the tendencies moral, mental and
spiritual, generated in previous lives, continually driving him on to certain
lines of action. The “Free Will absolute” of the theologians is as unpsychological
and worthless a concept as it is possible to formulate. Not so the
doctrine that the Ego is able to <em>mould</em> its tendencies of thought and emotion
within “constitutional limits.” It was the recognition of this fact which led
John Stuart Mill to take up a midway position between the equally absurd
extremes of Free Will and Necessarianism. The same conviction led the
prophet of Materialism, Dr. Louis Büchner, to contradict his whole
system by admitting human liberty within a certain area mapped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>out by “Heredity” and Environment, and Professor Clifford to
invest the “conscious, automaton” Man with the power to control his
own ideas!! Responsibility varies enormously, and is, perhaps, almost wanting
in the savage (who, however, is in all cases the degraded relic of primæval
civilisation). In all cases, the human Ego must be held to be the evolver of
the group of tendencies which make up the personality of each re-birth. The
sensualist is the victim of a “Frankenstein’s monster,” into which he has
infused strength through many lives. We really cannot follow Mr. Beatty when
he writes: “Has man instincts, desires, and inclinations, or has he not? If
he has, <em>why should he have them if he is not to follow them</em>?” He has them
because they are the heritage handed down to him from past lives, and also
because his Karma as an individual is bound up with that of the race to which
he belongs. It rests with him as to how far he chooses to <em>modify</em> them “for
weal or woe,” for every moment the exhaustion of past Karma runs parallel with
the creation of new. It is certainly a strange doctrine here enunciated by Mr.
Beatty, that the possession of certain “instincts, etc,” justifies their gratification.
Crime, debauchery and cruelty would be difficult to deal with on this hypothesis!
It is certainly true—to some extent—that “we are good or bad by reason of all
the forces that act on or through us.” These latter are the stimuli to action
(<em>subject to the control of the will</em>), but are in their turn the resultant of previous
Karma. Judging from the general tone of his criticism, it would appear that
his first acquaintance with the esoteric philosophy does not date back to a very
remote antiquity.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>“THE LATEST ATTACK ON CHRISTIANITY.”</h4>

<p class='c035'>In the July number of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> there is an article reviewing the
recent book of J. C. Morrison upon “The Service of Man or the Future
Religion.” And although Mr. Morrison, in his book, writes to urge that the chief
and primary principle of religion is “to promote the spirit of self-sacrifice, and to
direct men’s energies to the service of their fellow creatures,” yet the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> pours every kind of insult and obloquy on Mr. Morrison.</p>

<p class='c028'>But herein is the gross contradiction, that the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> admits that
the primary principle of Christianity has the very same objects in view, as Mr.
Morrison urges the future religion should have. And yet the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
ridicules Mr. Morrison, and describes his book as an attack upon Christianity.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then, surely, when two persons thus fall out with one another, whilst both
advocate the same lofty and noble principles, there must be some gross misunderstanding
between them!</p>

<p class='c028'>The error thus which they both labour under, is one and the same; for the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> errs, in assuming that the teaching or doctrine of the Church
is indisputably, and infallibly, the teaching or doctrine of Christ. And Mr.
Morrison errs in assuming that the teaching or doctrine of Christ is the same
as the doctrine of the Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>So that if the teaching of the Church is not the teaching of Christ, then Mr.
Morrison in attacking the supposed Christianity of the Church is not really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>attacking Christianity, but only attacking the spurious doctrine of the Church,
which has passed current as Christianity; <em>ex gr.</em>, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Elijah,
in denouncing the religion of the priests, did not attack true religion (as the
priests would assert), but only their adulterated and spurious religion.</p>

<p class='c028'>And Christ tells us that the Priests and Pharisees made the word of God
of none effect by their traditions. And St Paul tells us that, with the authority
of the Chief Priest, he had, before conversion, imprisoned and put men to
death, and made them blaspheme (Acts xxvi., 11) against God and the Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore, before we accept the Church and Christianity to be synonymous
terms, and not only signifying but being actually the Church of Christ,
and so, verily, Christianity, we must have a clear and definite understanding
as to what we mean, and wish others to understand what we mean, by “the
Church.”</p>

<p class='c028'>For the world, outside of Christianity, and often inside, is at its wits’ end to
know which of the numerous churches and sects, which all claim to be the
Church of Christ, is really and truly the Church of Christ; because the World
witnesses that they all reject one another.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then surely, whilst the world witnesses rival and hostile churches all claiming
to be “the Church” and Christianity, Mr. Morrison is not at all necessarily
attacking the Church of Christ, or true Christianity, when he attacks the doctrine,
or the Christianity of the churches.</p>

<p class='c028'>And this proposition of course, opens and raises the question as to what is
Christianity, which the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> either avoids or assumes to be
established, as being “<em>a sound belief in the merits of the Saviour</em>,” which of course
means belief in the Atonement as commonly taught. But how can the truth of
Christianity be possibly established, whilst to this day the doctrine of Atonement
taught by the Church as Christianity, cannot be reconciled as either good
or true; and is moreover a mystery to the leaders of it, a stumbling block to
the Jews, and foolishness to the world, making the preaching of the Church as
Canon Liddon admits, utterly powerless? The <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> assumes that
the doctrine of the Church has been taught as Christianity for 1,800 years; and
that 1,800 years’ teaching of it has proved it to be Christianity, because the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> assumes that there has been liberty for 1,800 years to disprove
the doctrine of the Church, and that the doctrine of the Church, not
having been disproved, is a proof that it cannot be disproved. But the fact that
to this very day there is no liberty allowed in the pulpits of the National
Churches to discuss the doctrine of the Church (it being a law with the rulers
of the Church that “the doctrine of the Church may not be touched”),
utterly refutes all the assumptions of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>.</p>

<p class='c028'>For whilst there is no liberty, even for fair and candid criticism in the pulpit,
on the doctrine of the Church, even in this age of liberty and education, there
could have been none when the Church, for centuries, had power to imprison,
slay, and excommunicate or boycott; and used it against those who even
questioned the doctrine of the Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>But we are told, by the great Bishop Butler, in his “Analogy of Religion”
(and whom the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> admits to be an authority of the very highest
class), that the doctrine of Atonement is positively immoral, excepting for the
supposed divine authority; and the Bishop himself looked forward to the day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>when the progress of liberty and education should throw greater light upon this
doctrine of the Church, and indisputably determine whether or no it has the
divine authority, it was then supposed or asserted to have.</p>

<p class='c028'>So great has been our progress in education and liberty that <cite>The
Guardian</cite> of the 3rd August, in its review of this book of Mr. Morrison’s, says,
if Christianity is Calvinism with its doctrine of substitution and justification,
then it is <em>madness</em> any longer to attempt defending the morality of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is true that it is one thing to make this admission in the review of a book,
and another thing to publish it from the pulpit; and it is true that the admission
would be withdrawn or crucified by silence; but the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> itself,
in its argument by analogy of the human and divine mind, admits that this
doctrine of Atonement is immoral, because it admits that no authority could be
divine which called immorality morality, as it asserts that <em>whatever is moral
humanly speaking, is also moral divinely speaking, only in an infinitely greater
degree</em>, and the converse. So that an attack on an immoral doctrine of the
Church is not an attack on Christianity, if the doctrine of the Church is not the
teaching of Christ, as it can be shown that it is not, as soon as liberty is
allowed in the pulpits of the National Churches, for explaining the truth of a
<em>Crucified Christ</em>, and removing the mystery that has been created, which causes
it to be a stumbling block to the Jews, and foolishness to the world.</p>

<p class='c028'>We are told that the late Archbishop Whately said, that if the Christian
Religion did not come from God, miraculously (in the sense commonly taught),
yet the religion, nevertheless, exists, and therefore the phenomenon has to be
explained how it could have arisen and been propagated without miracles.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> asserts that for 1,800 years all the attempts to
explain it, without the aid of miracles, have utterly failed, and therefore it must
be assumed to be miraculous.</p>

<p class='c028'>But before there can be any justification for such a bold assumption, as that
what is taught as Christianity is infallibly, and indisputably, the teaching of Jesus
Christ, what is meant by the term Christianity, or Christian religion must be
clearly defined: for the Roman Catholic Church denounces the Protestant,
and the Protestant denounces the Roman Church, as having naught to do with
Christianity; so that even if there is anything held in common between these
Churches (as “the faith of the Primitive Church,” or “the faith once delivered
to the Saints,” or any other faith), yet whatever it is, or is called, it would seem
to be of not the slightest value whatever, in saving them from rejecting one
another absolutely.</p>

<p class='c028'>Canon Liddon, however, asserts that all the doctrine and teaching of the
Church derives its authority from a miraculous resurrection of Jesus, with a material
and physical body of flesh, blood, and bones, in direct defiance of the teaching
of Jesus, that the flesh profiteth nothing, and that it was the words which He
spoke, “<em>They were</em> spirit, <em>they</em> were life.” (John vi., 63.)</p>

<p class='c028'>And if we believe that the Holy Spirit of God could speak without the aid
of a material body, composed of flesh, blood, and bones, in a still small voice
to the conscience or soul of Moses and Elijah (1 Kings xix., 12); and if we
believe that the same Holy Spirit is <em>present</em> even now (where two or three are
gathered together—Matt, xvii., 23), why should not the presence of the still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>small voice of the Holy Spirit, speaking to the conscience or soul of the Apostles,
be of itself deemed sufficient, without needing the aid of a material body?</p>

<p class='c028'>Again, if the <em>presence</em> of the still small voice of the Holy Spirit, speaking to the
soul of man, has been deemed sufficient by the world both before the crucifixion
of Christ, and since the crucifixion of Christ, why should it be deemed necessary
to raise up the crucified One, with a body of flesh, blood and bones, only to
teach what the still small voice of the Holy Spirit was able, willing, and <em>present</em>
to teach, and to doubt which would be Atheism? And, moreover, whilst such
teaching was sufficient, it would be a contradiction to vouchsafe more.</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore, if the still small voice of the Holy Spirit is sufficient and <em>present</em>
to guide us into all truth, it must have been sufficient for the Apostles also
(John xvi., 13); and, therefore, Christ’s religion is not dependent upon a
material resurrection of the body, with flesh, blood and bones.</p>

<p class='c028'>Here, once more, we see the necessity of liberty being allowed in the pulpit, for
fair and candid criticism on the doctrine of the Church, for the purpose of
eliminating error and eliciting truth; so that it may be clearly seen and known
what is Christ’s religion, as it might indeed be possible that a material resurrection
would seem necessary to support the doctrine of the Church, though
wholly unnecessary for the support of Christ’s religion, or gospel.</p>

<p class='c028'>Although the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> asserts that men have failed for 1,800
years to account for the existence of Christianity, unless it had a miraculous
resurrection to support it, yet it by no means follows that, because a miracle
is supposed to be needed to support a doctrine of the Church, therefore a
miracle is needed for supporting the doctrine, gospel, or religion of Christ; which
exists, and will continue to exist, without needing the aid of belief in a
miraculous resurrection of the material body, to support it. And it only needs
that there should be liberty allowed in the pulpits of the National Churches
to show the deficiency of faith in Christ’s spiritual resurrection, to see there
is no need for belief in that carnal, gross, and material resurrection of the
body, with flesh, blood and bones.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then, let there be liberty allowed in the pulpits of the National Churches;
because it is not true that there has ever been liberty for 1,800 years to explain the
Mystery of a Crucified Christ; for, it is refused to the present day. If any
man, on behalf of the Church, contradicts this, and asserts there is liberty
to explain, in the Church, the truth of a crucified Christ, let him mention
one Church, or one clergyman that will allow it, and I will test its truth by
asking for the same permission that the rulers of the Synagogue accorded to
St Paul at Antioch, Acts xiii., 15.</p>

<p class='c028'>The <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> says the clergy have no objection to free discussion—that
it is the very air they breathe, and that it has been the life of Christian
Truth. These are bold and brave words, but where is there even one clergyman
that will endorse them, and act upon them? Where?</p>

<p class='c028'>Isaiah says, “Open ye the gates that the truth may enter in” (xxvi., 2).
But instead of reverencing the just and righteous “Son of Man,” the chief
priests and rulers of the Ancient Church condemned “the Just One,” to be
slain as a blasphemer, whose blood ought to be shed for an Atonement. And
the chief priests of our Church have combined that this doctrine should not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>touched, so that by their practice they make their statement of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
utterly untrue. For if there is one clergyman, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1887, who will support the
<i>Quarterly Review’s</i> statement, and open his pulpit for explaining the truth of
“Christ crucified” and proclaiming Christian truth, as taught by Christ—Where
is he? and who is he?</p>

<p class='c028'>And if there is not one, then need the Church be surprised that men attack,
not the Christianity of Jesus Christ, but only an erroneous doctrine of the
Church, miscalled Christianity?</p>

<p class='c028'>P.S.—Although the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> admits that Mr. Morrison has established
a high position in literature, and that he seeks to promote the same
lofty and noble principles as true Christianity inculcates; yet it speaks of Mr.
Morrison’s book as bad and incomplete; feeble and illogical; full of perversities,
monstrosities, misrepresentations, and misquotations; adding, that it is bitter, unscrupulous,
ignorant, inconsistent, offensive, bullying, brow-beating, overbearing,
absurd, and ridiculous, as well as indecent and false; insulting and flagrant; inconsecutive
and unjust; full of jugglery and a disgrace.</p>

<p class='c028'>Is this an exhibition of how theologians, or the clergy, as the reviewer is most
probably a clergyman, love free discussion, and crucify those from whom they
differ by damning them in this gross manner?</p>

    <div><span class='small'><i>To the Editors of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c028'>In the numerous letters that have repeatedly appeared recently in the <cite>Times</cite>
opposing the statements of the Rev. Canon Isaac Taylor, in his speech at the
late Church Congress, on the very great progress of Islam, and the comparative
failure of Christianity (as taught), in India and Africa, it is frequently asserted
that <em>“Islam is the only religion that has laid an immutable barrier on human
progress;”</em> and that <em><a id='corr322.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='no'>“no</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_322.29'><ins class='correction' title='no'>“no</ins></a></span> system could have been devised with more consummate skill
(than the Koran of Islam) for shutting out the light of truth, from the Nations
over which Islam has sway.”</em></p>

<p class='c028'>But surely this is equally as true of our Church, whilst it also makes it an
immutable law, as it has done to this day, that “<em>the doctrine of the Church may
not be touched</em>”? For how could any system have been devised with more consummate
skill for shutting out the light of truth, than to delude the people to
crucify “the Just One,” as a blasphemer whose blood ought to be shed for an
atonement, and afterwards to quote Scripture in support of this doctrine (as
necessary to be believed in order to escape being cursed here and damned
hereafter), and stamp out and boycott all who doubted it?</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet this is the present state of things.</p>

<p class='c028'>And therefore, whilst the clergy have power to say that “<em>the doctrine of the
Church may not be touched</em>,” how is the mystery of a Crucified Christ to be
explained and translated, so that it may be seen to be “<em>a light to lighten the
Gentiles, and also the glory of Israel</em>,” instead of being, as it is now, a
stumbling block to the Jews, foolishness to the world, and a mystery to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>teachers of it, making those who accept it, in India and Africa, worse than they
were before?</p>

<p class='c028'>Then is there not a cause for demanding that liberty should be allowed in the

it may no longer remain a mystery for want only of this liberty?</p>

<h4 class='c023'>HYLO-IDEALISM.—AN APOLOGY.</h4>

<p class='c035'>My attention has been directed to a somewhat slighting notice of the above
theory of human nature, on pages 72 and 75 of your issue for September, the
contents of which are, doubtless, most suggestive of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nouvelles couches
mentales</i></span> at the basis of all <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nouvelles couches sociales</i></span>, and which Physical Science,
in its vulgar realism, has altogether missed.</p>

<p class='c028'>My main position, to which all else is but subsidiary, is that the worlds both of
thought and thing, which thus become identified and unified, <em>must</em> be a product
of <em>our own</em> personality or Egoity, which thus constitutes each Ego Protagonist
and Demiurge, from whose tribunal there can be no possible appeal. This
being granted, and even Max Müller, in his “Science of Thought,” considers the
position <em>impregnable</em>, it matters not one jot, at least in the first line and as far as
my main object is concerned, whether the Ego be a Body or a “Spirit.” Our
own individuality, as sum and substance of all “things,” is the only essential
point of the question. So that it may be argued either on the somatic (hylozoic)
or “Spiritual” hypothesis of life and mind. I have always contended
that Hylo-Idealism, or Auto-centricism, is the only thorough and legitimate outcome
of the phenomenal world theory—this representative <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Weltanschanung</i></span>
having been, for some generations past, the accredited creed both of physical
science and philosophy. It is well summed up in Kant’s negation of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Das
Ding an sich</i></span>.$1“$2”$3 Vulgar Physical Science, as interpreted by its greatest hierophants,
from Newton to Huxley and Darwin, from its incarnate dualism, is fatally
handicapped in its search after the <em>final</em> “good, beautiful, and true.” Even
Cardinal Newman is in a similar case, when he predicates <em>two</em> luminous
spectra, God and Self, as the sole entities. The former Spectrum, on the Hylo-ideal,
or visional, or phenomenal hypothesis, <em>must</em> be only the functional <em>imago</em>
of the latter; Self being thus proved to be “Alpha and Omega, beginning and
ending, first and last.” Beyond Self, it is manifest, mortal mind can never
range. Whether Self be body or “spirit” is, I repeat, for my chief contention,
quite immaterial—I sit on both sides of the stile, facing both ways.</p>

<p class='c028'>As a hostile notice of the above philosophy has appeared in your columns, will you
kindly permit me to say a few words in its defence? Not, of course, that I can
hope in these few lines to really make clear to the casual reader the greatest
change in human thought ever witnessed on earth (a change not merely as
regards the form or matter of existence, but as regards its very nature)—yet I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>may hope that a few seasonable words may be the means of inducing at least a few
to enquire further into a theory, the self-evident simplicity of which is so great,
that, I am convinced, it needs but to be understood to command universal
acceptance.</p>

<p class='c028'>The term Hylo-Ideaism is no self-contradiction, but undeniable verity, based
on the first two facts of all existence; viz., the assumption of the material on
the one hand, and the actuality of the ideal on the other. The primary, undeniable
and necessary assumption of the “reality” of existence supplies us with
the first half of our designation, and the recognition of the correlative truism
that this existence—based on our own assumption—is, therefore, only our own
idea, completes our title, and amply vindicates the self-sufficiency of Hylo-Ideaistic
philosophy. For here is not a mere unended argument, leaving us at
both ends stranded on mere metaphysical speculation, but a self-sustaining
circle<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c013'><sup>[116]</sup></a> where both ends meet, and materiality and ideality are blended as one,
and indissoluble.</p>

<p class='c028'>It matters not on what basis we proceed, whether we speak of existence as
material or ideal, or “spiritual” or anything else—a moment’s reflection is
sufficient to establish us in a position of consistent monism. For all thought
or knowledge is but sensation, and sensation is and must be purely subjective,
existing in, and by, the ego itself. As now we cannot outstrip our own sensations
(only a madman could controvert this proposition—which includes <em>everything</em>)—therefore
are we absolutely, and for ever, limited to self-existence, and the same
holds good of all possible or imaginary existence whatsoever. For the first
essential of any conscious existence—that which indeed constitutes it—is a
sentient subject, and inasmuch as all connected with this subject—thought,
knowledge, feeling, fancy, sentiment—are all <em>purely subjective</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, in the subject
itself, so must the subject be to itself the sum of all things, and objective existence
only its own fancy by which it realises itself. This then utterly disposes
of all fancied objective dualism by reducing all existence within the ring-fence of
the ego itself, and this not as mere speculative theory but as positive fact, which,
whether we recognise it or not, remains fact still—we <em>are</em> limited to Self,
whether we know it or not.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then finally, <em>in self</em>, we harmonise the antithesis between the material and
the ideal by recognising the two as absolutely inter-dependent, each upon the
other, and therefore one consistent and indivisible whole. The ideal (thought,
fancy, sentiment) is, and must be, but the property and outcome of the material
(the nominal reality), which, on the other hand, is itself (and can be) but the
assumption of the ideal. Destroy reality and thought is dead, blind thought
and reality is a blank; and thus are the ideal and the material but the two sides
of one and the self-same shield, and the line of our argument joins itself in one
consistent circle, which constitutes the existence of the Ego—He who creates
light and darkness, heaven and earth, pleasure and pain, God and devil—who is,
in Himself, the sum of all things, (viz. “thinks”) beyond which is naught,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>naught, naught, for the fancy of His own which imagines a “beyond” is, itself,
but fancy—self-contained in Self.</p>

<p class='c028'>[<span class='sc'>Editor’s Note.</span>—In reference to the supposed “slighting remark” of which
Dr. Lewins speaks, and the no less supposed “hostile notice,” as Mr. Herbert
L. Courtney puts it—contained in our September number—we demur to the
accusation. Both gentlemen will find it, however, fully answered in the
“Literary Jottings” of this number; where, also, their respective pamphlets
“<span class='sc'>Auto-Centricism</span>,” “<span class='sc'>Humanism</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>versus</i></span> <span class='sc'>Theism</span>,” and “The New Gospel

<p class='c035'>A <span class='sc'>Correspondent</span> from New York writes:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>.... “The Editors of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> would confer a great benefit on those who are attracted to the
movement which they advocate, if they would state:</p>

<p class='c028'>“(1.) Whether a would-be-theosophist-occultist is required to abandon his worldly ties and
duties such as family affection, love of parents, wife, children, friends, etc.?</p>

<p class='c028'>“I ask this question because it is rumoured here that some theosophical publications have so stated,
and would wish to know whether such a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sine quâ non</i></span> condition really exists in your Rules? The same,
however, is found in the New Testament. ‘He that loveth father or mother more than Me, is not
worthy of Me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me, etc., etc.,’
is said in Matthew (x. 37). Do the <span class='sc'>Masters</span> of Theosophy demand as much?</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c028'>This is an old, old question, and a still older charge against theosophy,
started first by its enemies. We emphatically answer, <span class='fss'>NO</span>; adding that no
<em>theosophical</em> publication could have rendered itself guilty of such a <span class='fss'>FALSEHOOD</span>
and calumny. No follower of theosophy, least of all a disciple of the “Masters
of Theosophy” (the <em>chela</em> of a <em>guru</em>), would ever be accepted on such conditions.
Many were the candidates, but “few the chosen.” Dozens were
refused, simply because married and having a sacred duty to perform to wife
and children.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c013'><sup>[117]</sup></a> None have ever been asked to forsake father or mother; for
he who, being necessary to his parent for his support, leaves him or her to
gratify his own selfish consideration or thirst for knowledge, however great and
sincere, <i>is “unworthy”</i> of the Science of Sciences, “or ever to approach a holy
<span class='sc'>Master</span>.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Our correspondent must surely have confused in his mind Theosophy with
Roman Catholicism, and Occultism with the dead-letter teachings of the Bible.
For it is only in the Latin Church that it has become a meritorious action, which
is called serving God and Christ, to “abandon father and mother, wife and
children,” and every duty of an honest man and citizen, in order to become
a monk. And it is in St. Luke’s Gospel that one reads the terrible words, put in
the mouth of Jesus: “If any <em>man</em> come to me, and <em>hate not his father, and
mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters</em>, yea, <em>his own life</em> also,
<span class='fss'>HE CANNOT BE MY DISCIPLE</span>.” (xiv. 26.)</p>

<p class='c028'><em>Saint</em> (?) Jerome teaches, in one of his writings, “If thy father lies down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>across thy threshold, if thy mother uncovers to thine eyes the bosom which
suckled thee, <i>trample on thy father’s lifeless body</i>, <span class='fss'>TRAMPLE ON THY MOTHER’S
BOSOM</span>, and <em>with eyes unmoistened and dry, fly to the Lord, who calleth thee</em>!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Surely then, it is not from any <em>theosophical</em> publication that our correspondent
could have learnt such an infamous charge against theosophy and its <span class='fss'>MASTERS</span>—but
rather in some <em>anti-Christian</em>, or <em>too</em> dogmatically “Christian” paper.</p>

<p class='c028'>Our society has never been “more Catholic than the Pope.” It has done
its best to follow out the path prescribed by the Masters; and if it has failed in
more than one respect to fulfil its arduous task, the blame is certainly not to
be thrown on either Theosophy, nor its Masters, but on the limitations of
human nature. The <em>Rules</em>, however, of <em>chelaship</em>, or discipleship, are there, in
many a Sanskrit and Tibetan volume. In Book IV. of <em>Kiu-ti</em>, in the chapter on
“<em>the Laws of Upasans</em>” (disciples), the qualifications expected in a “regular
<em>chela</em>” are: (1.) Perfect physical health.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c013'><sup>[118]</sup></a> (2.) Absolute mental and physical
purity. (3.) Unselfishness of purpose; universal charity; pity for all animate
beings. (4.) Truthfulness and unswerving faith in the laws of Karma. (5.) A
courage undaunted in the support of truth, even in face of peril to life. (6.) An
intuitive perception of one’s being the vehicle of the manifested divine <em>Atman</em>
(spirit). (7.) Calm indifference for, but a just appreciation of, everything that
constitutes the objective and transitory world. (8.) Blessing of both parents<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c013'><sup>[119]</sup></a>
and <em>their permission to become an Upasan</em> (chela); and (9.) Celibacy, and freedom
from any obligatory <a id='corr326.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='duty.”'>duty.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_326.22'><ins class='correction' title='duty.”'>duty.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>The two last rules are most strictly enforced. No man <em>convicted of disrespect
to his father or mother</em>, or <em>unjust abandonment of his wife</em>, can ever be accepted
even as a <em>lay chela</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is sufficient, it is hoped. We have heard of chelas who, having <em>failed</em>,
perhaps in consequence of the neglect of some such duty, for one or another
reason, have invariably thrown the blame and <a id='corr326.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='responsibiilty'>responsibility</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_326.28'><ins class='correction' title='responsibiilty'>responsibility</ins></a></span> for it on the
teaching of the Masters. This is but natural in poor and weak human beings
who have not even the courage to recognise their own mistakes, or the rare
nobility of publicly confessing them, but are always trying to find a scapegoat.
Such we pity, and leave to the Law of Retribution, or Karma. It is not these
weak creatures, who can ever be expected to have the best of the enemy
described by the wise Kirátárjuniya of Bharavi:—</p>

<div class='c037'>[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</div>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>We have received several communications for publication, bearing on the
subjects discussed in the editorial of our last issue, “Let every man prove his
own work.” A few brief remarks may be made, not in reply to any of the letters—<em>which,
being anonymous, and containing no card from the writers, cannot be
published</em> (nor are such noticed, as a general rule)—but to the ideas and
accusations contained in one of them, a letter signed “M.” Its author takes
up the cudgels on behalf of the Church. He objects to the statement that this
institution lacks the enlightenment necessary to carry out a true system of
philanthropy. He appears, also, to demur to the view that “the practical
people either go on doing good unintentionally and often do harm,” and points
to the workers amid our slums as a vindication of Christianity—which, by-the-bye,
was in no sense attacked in the editorial so criticized.</p>

<p class='c028'>To this, repeating what was said, we maintain that more mischief has been
done by emotional charity than sentimentalists care to face. Any student of
political economy is familiar with this fact, which passes for a truism with all
those who have devoted attention to the problem. No nobler sentiment than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>that which animates the unselfish philanthropist is conceivable; but the question
at issue is not summed up in the recognition of this truth. The practical
results of his labours have to be examined. We have to see whether he does
not sow the seeds of a greater—while relieving a lesser—evil.</p>

<p class='c028'>The fact that “thousands are making great efforts in all the cities throughout
our land” to meet want, reflects immense credit on the character of such
workers. It does not affect their creed, for such natures would remain the
same, whatever the prevailing dogmas chanced to be. It is certainly a very
poor illustration of the fruits of centuries of dogmatic Christianity that England
should be so honeycombed with misery and poverty as she is—especially on the
biblical ground that a tree must be judged by its fruits! It might, also, be
argued, that the past history of the Churches, stained as it is with persecutions,
the suppression of knowledge, crime and brutality, necessitates the turning over
of a new leaf. The difficulties in the way are insuperable. “Churchianity”
has, indeed, done its best to keep up with the age by assimilating the teachings
of, and making veiled truces with, science, but it is incapable of affording a true
spiritual ideal to the world.</p>

<p class='c028'>The same Church-Christianity assails with fruitlesss pertinacity, the ever-growing
host of Agnostics and Materialists, but is <em>as absolutely ignorant, as the
latter, of the mysteries beyond the tomb</em>. The great necessity for the Church,
according to Professor Flint, is to keep the leaders of European thought within
its fold. By such men it is, however, regarded as an anachronism. The Church
is eaten up with scepticism within its own walls; free-thinking clergymen being
now very common. This constant drain of vitality has reduced the true religion
to a very low ebb, and it is to infuse a new current of ideas and aspirations into
modern thought, in short, to supply a logical basis for an elevated morality, a
science and philosophy which is suited to the knowledge of the day, that Theosophy
comes before the world. Mere physical philanthropy, apart from the infusion of new
influences and ennobling conceptions of life into the minds of the masses,
is worthless. The gradual assimilation by mankind of great spiritual truths
will alone revolutionize the face of civilization, and ultimately result in a far
more effective panacea for evil, than the mere tinkering of superficial misery. Prevention
is better than cure. Society creates its own outcasts, criminals, and
profligates, and then condemns and punishes its own Frankensteins, sentencing
its own progeny, the “bone of its bone, and the flesh of its flesh,” to a life of
damnation on earth. Yet that society recognises and enforces most hypocritically
Christianity—<i>i.e.</i> “Churchianity.” Shall we then, or shall we not, infer that
the latter is unequal to the requirements of mankind? Evidently the former,
and most painfully and obviously so, in its present dogmatic form, which makes
of the beautiful ethics preached on the Mount, a Dead Sea fruit, a whitened
sepulchre, and no better.</p>

<p class='c028'>Furthermore, the same “M.,” alluding to Jesus as one with regard to whom
there could be only two alternatives, writes that he “was either the Son of God
or the vilest impostor who ever trod this earth.” We answer, not at all. Whether
the Jesus of the New Testament ever lived or not, whether he existed as an
historical personage, or was simply a lay figure around which the Bible allegories
clustered—the Jesus of Nazareth of Matthew and John, is the ideal for every
would-be sage and Western candidate Theosophist to follow. That such an
one as he, was <em>a</em> “Son of God,” is as undeniable as that he was neither the <em>only</em>
“Son of God,” nor the first one, nor even the last who closed the series of the
“Sons of God,” or the children of Divine Wisdom, on this earth. Nor is that
other statement that in “His life he (Jesus) has ever spoken of himself as
co-existent with Jehovah, the Supreme, the Centre of the Universe,” correct,
whether in <a id='corr327.55'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in it its'>in its</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_327.55'><ins class='correction' title='in it its'>in its</ins></a></span> dead letter, or hidden mystic sense. In no place does Jesus
ever allude to “<em>Jehovah</em>”; but, on the contrary, attacking the Mosaic laws and
the alleged Commandments given on Mount Sinai, he disconnects himself and
his “Father” most distinctly and emphatically from the Sinaitic tribal God.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>The whole of Chapter V., in the Gospel of Matthew, is a passionate protest of
the “man of peace, love and charity,” against the cruel, stern, and selfish
commandments of “the man of war,” the “Lord” of Moses (Exod. xv., 3).
“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old times,”—so and so—“But I
say unto you,” quite the reverse. Christians who still hold to the Old Testament
and the Jehovah of the Israelites, are at best <em>schismatic Jews</em>. Let them
be that, by all means, if they will so have it; but they have no right to call
themselves even <em>Chréstians</em>, let alone <em>Christians</em>.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c013'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>It is a gross injustice and untruth to assert, as our anonymous correspondent
does, that “the freethinkers are notoriously unholy in their lives.” Some of
the noblest characters, as well as deepest thinkers of the day, adorn the ranks of
Agnosticism, Positivism and Materialism. The latter are the worst enemies of
Theosophy and Mysticism; but this is no reason why strict justice should not be
done unto them. Colonel Ingersoll, a rank materialist, and the leader of freethought
in America, is recognised, even by his enemies, as an ideal husband,
father, friend and citizen, one of the noblest characters that grace the United
States. Count Tolstoi is a freethinker who has long parted with the orthodox
Church, yet his whole life is an exemplar of Christ-like altruism and self-sacrifice.
Would to goodness every “Christian” should take those two “<em>infidels</em>” as his
models in private and public life. The munificence of many freethinking
philanthropists stands out in startling contrast with the apathy of the monied
dignitaries of the Church. The above fling at the “enemies of the Church,” is
as absurd as it is contemptible.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What can you offer to the dying woman who fears to tread alone the <span class='fss'>DARK
UNKNOWN</span>?” we are asked. Our Christian critic here frankly confesses (<i>a.</i>) that
Christian dogmas have only developed <em>fear</em> of death, and (<i>b.</i>) the <em>agnosticism</em> of
the <em>orthodox believer</em> in Christian theology as to the future <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>post-mortem</i></span> state.
It is, indeed, difficult to appreciate the peculiar type of bliss which orthodoxy
offers its believers in—<em>damnation</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>The dying man—the average Christian—with a <em>dark</em> retrospect in life can
scarcely appreciate this boon; while the Calvinist or the Predestinarian, who
is brought up in the idea that God may have pre-assigned him from eternity to
everlasting misery, through no fault of that man, but simply because he is God, is
more than justified in regarding the latter as ten times worse than any devil or
fiend that unclean human fancy could evolve.</p>

<p class='c028'>Theosophy, on the contrary, teaches that <em>perfect, absolute justice</em> reigns in
nature, though short-sighted man fails to see it in its details on the material and
even psychic plane, and that every man determines his own future. The true
Hell is life on Earth, as an effect of Karmic punishment following the preceding
life during which the evil causes were produced. The Theosophist fears <em>no
hell</em>, but confidently expects rest and bliss during the <em>interim</em> between two
incarnations, as a reward for all the unmerited suffering he has endured in an
existence into which he was ushered by Karma, and during which he is, in most
cases, as helpless as a torn-off leaf whirled about by the conflicting winds of
social and private life. Enough has been given out at various times regarding
the conditions of post-mortem existence, to furnish a solid block of information
on this point. Christian theology has nothing to say on this burning question,
except where it veils its ignorance by mystery and dogma; but Occultism, unveiling
the symbology of the Bible, explains it thoroughly.—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

    <div>HYLO-IDEALISM <i>versus</i> “LUCIFER,” and the “ADVERSARY.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Under the head of <span class='sc'>Correspondence</span>
in the present number, two remarkable
letters are published. (See Text.) Both
come from fervent Hylo-Idealists—a
Master and Disciple, if we mistake not—and
both charge the “Adversary,” one, of
a “slighting,” the other, of a “hostile notice”
of Hylo-Idealism, in the September
number of “<cite>Lucifer</cite>.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Such an accusation is better met and
answered in all sincerity; and, therefore,
the reply is, a flat denial of the charge.
No <em>slight</em>—nor <em>hostility</em> either, could be
shown to “Hylo-Idealism,” as the “little
stranger” in the happy family of philosophies
was hitherto as good as unknown
to “Lucifer’s” household gods. It was
<em>chaff</em>, if anything, but surely no hostility;
and even that was concerned with only
some dreadful words and sentences, with
reference to the new teaching, and had
nothing whatever to do with Hylo-Idealism
proper—a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span> for the writer
at the time. But now that three pamphlets
from the pens of our two correspondents
have been received in our office, for
review, and carefully read, Hylo-Idealism
begins to assume a more tangible form
before the reviewer’s eye. It becomes
easier to separate the grain from the
chaff, the theory from the (no doubt)
scientific, nevertheless, most irritating,
words in which it is presented to the
reader.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>This is meant in all truth and sincerity.
The remarks which our two correspondents
have mistaken for expressions of hostility,
were as justified <em>then</em>, as they are
<em>now</em>. What ordinary mortal, we ask, before
he had time (to use Dr. Lewins’
happiest expressions) to “<em>asself</em> or <em>cognose</em>”—let
alone <em>intercranialise</em><a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c013'><sup>[121]</sup></a> (!!)—the
hylo-idealistic theories, however profound
and philosophical these may be, who,
having so far come into direct contact
with only the <em>images</em> thereof “subjected
by his own <em>egoity</em>” (<i>i.e.</i> as words and sentences),
who could avoid feeling his hair
standing on end, over “<em>his organs of mentation</em>,”
while spelling out such terrible
words as “<em>vesiculo-neurosis</em> in conjunction
with <em>medico-psychological symptomatology</em>,”
“<em>auto-centricism</em>,” and the like?
Such interminable, outlandish, multisyllabled
and multicipital, newly-coined compound
terms and whole sentences, maybe,
and no doubt are, highly learned and
scientific. They may be most expressive
of true, real meaning, to a specialist
of Dr. Lewins’ powers of thought; nevertheless,
I make bold to say, that they are
far more calculated to obscure than to
enlighten the ordinary reader. In our
modern day, when new philosophies spring
out from the spawn of human overworked
intellect like mushrooms from their mycelium
after a rainy morning, the human
brain and its capacities ought to be taken
into a certain thoughtful consideration,
and spared useless labour. Notwithstanding
Dr. Lewins’ praiseworthy efforts
to prove that brain (as far as we understand
his aspirations and teachings) is the
only reality in the whole kosmos, its limitations
are painfully evident, on the whole.
As philanthropists and theosophists, we
entreat the founder of Hylo-Idealism and
his disciples to be merciful to their new
god, the “Ego-Brain,” and not tax too
heavily its powers, if they would see it
happily reign. For otherwise, it is sure to
collapse before the new theory—or, let us
call it philosophy—is even half appreciated
by that “Ego-Brain.”</p>

<p class='c028'>By speaking as we do, we are only pursuing
a life-long policy. We have
criticized and opposed the coinage of
hard Greek and Latin words by the New
York Pantarchists; laughed at Hæckel’s
pompous tendency to invent thirty-three
syllabled terms, and speak of the <em>perigenesis</em>
of <em>plastidules</em>, instead of honest
whirling atoms—or whatever he means;
and derided the modern psychists for calling
simple thought transference “telepathic
impact.” And now, we tearfully beg Dr.
Lewins, in the interests of humanity, to
have pity on his poor readers: for, unless
he hearkens to our advice, we shall be
compelled, in dire self-defence, to declare
an open war to his newly-coined words.
We shall fight the usurper “Solipsism” in

<p class='c028'>At the same time, as we have hitherto
been ignorant of the latest philosophy,
described by Mr. H. L. Courtney as “the
greatest change in human thought,” may
we be permitted to enquire whether it is
spelt as its Founder spells it, namely,
“Hylo-Idealism,” or as his disciple, Mr.
Courtney does, who writes Hylo-Ideaism?
Is the latter a <em>schism</em>, an improvement on
the original name, a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>lapsus calami</i></span>, or
what? And now, having <a id='corr330L.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='dirburdened'>disburdened</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_330L.14'><ins class='correction' title='dirburdened'>disburdened</ins></a></span>
our heart of a heavy weight, we may proceed
to give an opinion (so far very superficial),
on the three Hylo-Idealistic (or
<cite>Ideaistic</cite>) pamphlets.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'><i>Under the extraordinary title of</i>
“AUTO-CENTRICISM” and “HUMANISM
<i>versus</i> THEISM,” or “Solipsism
(Egoism)=Atheism” (W. Stewart
&amp; Co., 41, Farringdon Street, E.C.;
and Freethought Publishing Co., 63,
Fleet Street, E.C.)—Dr. Lewins publishes
a series of letters on the subject
of the philosophy of which he is the
founder. It is impossible not to feel admiration
for the manner in which these
letters are written. They show a great deal
of sincere conviction and deep thought, and
give evidence of a most wide and varied
reading. However his readers may dissent
from the writer’s conclusions, the
research with which he has strengthened
his theory, cannot fail to attract their attention,
and smooth their way through the
somewhat tortuous labyrinth of arguments
before them. But—</p>

<p class='c035'>Dr. Lewins is among those who regard
consciousness as a function of the nerve-tissue;
and in this aspect, he is an uncompromising
materialist. Yet, on the other
hand, he holds that the Universe, God,
and thought, have no reality whatever,
apart from the individual Ego. The Ego
is again resolvable into brain-process.
We thus arrive at the doctrine that Brain
is the workshop in which all our ideas of
external things are originated. Apart
from brain there is no Ego, no external
world. What, then, is the Brain itself—this
solitary object in a void universe?
Hylo-Idealism does not say. Thus, the
author cannot escape the confusion of
thought which his unique working-union
of materialism and idealism involves.
The <em>oscillation</em> between these two poles is
strikingly apparent in the subjoined quotations.
At one point Matter is discussed
as if it were an objective reality; at another,
it is regarded as a mere “phantasm
of the Ego.” The Brain alone survives
throughout in solitary state. We quote
from the two pamphlets—</p>

<p class='c028'>Matter is at one time credited with a
real being, and again resolved into a mere
mental figment as <em>circumstances demand</em>.
If Matter is, as the author frequently
states, unreal, it is, at least clear that the
brain, one of its many phases, goes with
it!!</p>

<p class='c028'>As to the learned doctor’s assertion that
perception is relative, a theory which runs
through his whole work, we have but one
answer. This conception is, in no sense
whatever, a monopoly of Hylo-Idealists,
as Dr. Lewins appears to think. The illusory
nature of the phenomenal world—of
the things of sense—is not only a belief
common to the old Brahminical metaphysics,
and to the majority of modern
psychologists, but it is also a vital tenet of
Theosophy. The latter distinctly realises
matter as a “bundle of attributes,” ultimately
resolvable into the subjective
sensations of a “percipient.” The connection
of this simple truth with the hylo-idealistic
denial of soul is not apparent.
Its acceptance has, also, no bearing on the
problem as to whether there may not
exist a duality—<em>within the limits of manifested
being</em>—or contrast between Mind
and the Substance of matter. This
Cosmic Duality is symbolised by the
Vedantins in the relations between the
Logos and Mulaprakriti—<i>i.e.</i>, the Universal
Spirit and the “material” basis (or
root) of the objective planes of nature.
The <em>Monism</em>, then, of Dr. Lewins and
other negative thinkers of the day, is evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>at fault, when applied to unify the
contrast of mental and material facts in
the conditioned universe. Beyond the
latter, it is indeed valid, but that is
scarcely a question for practical philosophy.</p>

<p class='c028'>To close with a reference this once to
Dr. Lewins’ letter (see “Correspondence”
in the text), in which he makes his subsequent
assertion to the effect that God
is the “functional (<i>sic</i>) image,” of the
Ego, we should prefer to suggest that all
individual “selves” are but dim reflections
of the universal soul of the Kosmos. The
orthodox concept of God is not, as he
contends, a myth or phantasm of the
brain; it is rather an expression of a
vague consciousness of the universal, all-pervading
Logos. It is because <span class='sc'>Self</span>
pinions man within a narrow sphere
“beyond which mortal mind can never
range,” that the destruction of the personal
sense of separateness is indispensable
to the Occultist.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>“THE NEW GOSPEL OF HYLO-IDEALISM,
<cite>or Positive Agnosticism</cite>,”
(Freethought Publishing Co., 73, Fleet
Street, E. C. Price 3d.), is another
pamphlet on the same subject, in
which Mr. Herbert L. Courtney contributes
his quota to the discussion of the
“Brain Theory of mind and matter.” He
is, if we mistake not, an avowed disciple
of Dr. Lewins, and, perhaps, identical
with the “C. N.,” who watched over the
cradle of the “new philosophy.” The
whole gist of the latter may be summed
up as an attempt to frame a working-union
of Materialism and Idealism. This
result is effected on two lines (1) in the
acceptance of the idealistic theorem, that
the so-called external world only exists in
our consciousness; and (2) in the designation
of that consciousness, in its turn, as
a mere function of Brain. The first
of these contentions is unquestionably
valid, in so far as it concerns the world
of appearances, or <em>Maya</em>; it is, however,
as “old as the hills,” and incorporated
into the Hylo-Ideal argument from anterior
sources. The second is untenable,
for the simple reason that on the premises
of the new creed itself, the brain, as an
object of perception, can possess no reality
outside of the Ego. Hegelians might
reply that Brain is but an <i>i.e.</i> of the Ego,
and cannot hence determine the existence
of the latter—its creator.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>Metaphysicism will, however, find much
to interest them in Mr. Courtney’s brochure,
representative, as it is, of the new
and more subtle phase into which modern
scepticism is entering. Some expressions
we may demur to—<i>e.g.</i>, “That which we
see is not Sirius, but the light-wave.” So
far from the light-wave being “seen,” it is
a mere working hypothesis of Science.
All we experience is the retinal sensation,
the objective counterpart to which is a
matter of pure inference. So far as we
can learn, Hylo-Idealism is chiefly based
upon gigantic paradoxes, and even contradictions
in terms. For, with regard to
the speculations anent the Noumenon
(p. 8.) what justification can be found for
terming it “<span class='sc'>Matter</span>,” especially as it is
said to be “unknowable”? Obviously it
may be of the nature of mind, or—<em>something</em>
<span class='sc'>Higher</span>. How is the Hylo-Idealist
to know?</p>

<p class='c028'>“LAYS OF ROMANCE AND CHIVALRY,”

In this neat little volume the author presents
to the reader a collection of vigorous

Some of these pieces, such as the “Raid
of Vikings” and “Glencoe,” are of merit,
despite an occasional echo of Walter
Scott, whose style seems to have had a
considerable modifying influence on the
author’s diction. It is in the “Bride of

a former article in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, entitled
“The Origin of Evil.” We find, however,
Mr. Beatty exhibiting crass ignorance
of the ideas he criticises, as when,
for instance, he speaks of the “<em>Buddhistic</em>”
Parabram (<i>sic</i>). To begin with,
every tyro in Oriental philosophy knows
that “Parabrahm” is a Hindu Vedantic
idea, and has no connection whatever

must first learn the <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, of the subject

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>THE GNOSTICS AND THEIR
REMAINS, ANCIENT AND MEDIÆVAL.
By C. W. King, M.A. Second
Edition. David Nutt, 270 Strand, London,
1887. pp. 466, 8vo.</p>

<p class='c028'>It would be unfair to the erudite and
painstaking author of “<cite>The Gnostics and
Their Remains</cite>” for a reviewer to take the
title of his book as altogether appropriate,
for it suggests too high a standard of criticism.
Mr. King says in the introduction
that his book is intended to be subsidiary
to the valuable treatise of M. Matter,
adding: “I refer the reader to him for
the more complete elucidation of the <em>philosophy</em>
of Gnosticism, and give my full attention
to its <em>Archæological</em> side.” The
italics are the author’s, and they disarm
<a id='corr332L.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='cricicism'>criticism</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_332L.18'><ins class='correction' title='cricicism'>criticism</ins></a></span> as far as the philosophical side
of Gnosticism is concerned; for thus italicised,
this passage is, at the outset, as
plain a confession as could, in conscience,
be expected of an author of a fact which
the reader would probably have found out
for himself, before he closed the volume:
namely, that the work is chiefly valuable
as an Archæological compendium of
“Gnostic Remains.” Unfortunately, the
most interesting point about the Gnostics
is their philosophy, of which their Archæological
remains are, properly speaking,
little more than illustrations. But the fact
is, that the hard-shelled Archæologist is
the last man in the world to appreciate the
real esoteric signification of symbolism.
All true symbols have many meanings, and
for the purposes of descriptive Archæology
the more superficial of these meanings are
sufficient. Ignorance of the deeper meaning
may indeed be bliss for the Archæologist,
for it necessitates an amount of ingenuity
in the fitting together of “remains,”
that commands the admiration of the
public, and is productive in the Archæological
bosom of that agreeable sensation
known as “fancying oneself.” As a
laborious collector and compiler, and an
ingenious worker-up of materials into
interesting reading, too much can hardly
be said in Mr. King’s praise, and had he
a greater intuitional power, and a knowledge
of esoteric religion, his great
industry and erudition would make his
writings valuable even to students of
Occultism.</p>

<p class='c028'>Since the publication of the former
edition of his work, twenty-three years ago,
Mr. King has come across and read the
<cite>Pistis Sophia</cite>. The discovery of this, the
only remaining Gnostic Gospel, or rather,
Gospel fragment, is attributed to
Schwartze, and the Latin translation to
Petermann (in 1853). But Mr. King
does not seem to be aware that
as far back as 1843, another and
ampler copy than that in the British
Museum was in the hands of a Russian
Raskolnik (dissident), a Cossack, who
lived and married in Abyssinia; and another
is in the possession of an Englishman, an
Occultist, now in the United States, who
brought it from Syria. It seems a pity
that in the interim Mr. King did not
also read <cite>Isis Unveiled</cite>, by H. P.
Blavatsky, published by Bouton in New
York in 1876, as its perusal would have
saved him a somewhat absurd and ludicrous
blunder. In his <cite>Preface</cite>, Mr. King
says:—“There seems to be reason for
suspecting that the Sibyl of Esoteric
Buddhism drew the first notions of her
new religion from the analysis of the
<em>inner man</em>, as set forth in my first
edition.”<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c013'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The only person to whom this
passage could apply is one of the Editors,
the author of <cite>Isis Unveiled</cite>. And this,
her first publication, contains the same
and only doctrine she has always, or
ever, promulgated. <cite>Isis Unveiled</cite> has
passed through eight editions, and has
been read by many thousands of persons;
and not only they, but everyone
who is not strangely ignorant
of the very literature with which it was
Mr. King’s business to make himself
conversant, are perfectly aware that the
two large volumes which compose that
work are entirely devoted to a defence of
the philosophy, science, and religion of
the ancients, especially of the old
Aryans, whose religion can hardly be
called a “new” one, still less—“Esoteric
Buddhism.” If properly spelt, however,
the latter word, or Buddhism, ought
to be written with one “d,” as in
this case it means Wisdom. But “Budhism,”
or the wisdom-religion of the
Aryans, was still less a religion, in
the exoteric sense, than is Buddhism,
but rather a philosophy. In that
part of <cite>Isis Unveiled</cite> which treats of
the Gnostics, Mr. King will find a few
quotations from his writings side by side
with quotations from other writers on the
same subject; but he will find no “new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>religion” there, or anywhere else, in the
works of H. P. Blavatsky. And, if anyone
drew the “first notions” of their religion
from his “analysis of the inner man,” it
must have been the early Aryans, who,
unfortunately, have neglected to acknowledge
the obligation. What makes Mr.
King’s self-complacency the more ridiculous,
is that in his preface he himself
accuses someone else of “the grave error
of representing their (the Gnostics’) doctrines
as <em>novel</em>, and the pure <em>inventions</em>
of the persons who preached them.” And
in another place he confesses that he owes
to Matter the first idea which has now
become a settled conviction with him, that
“the seeds of the <em>gnosis</em> were originally
of Indian growth.” If Matter “faintly
discerned” this truth, on the other hand
Bailly, Dupuis, and others had seen it
quite clearly, and had declared it most
emphatically. So that Mr. King’s “discovery”
is neither very new nor very
original.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. King must be aware that of late
years immense additions have been made
to western knowledge of eastern philosophies
and religions—a new region in
ancient literature having, in fact, been
opened up by the labours of Orientalists,
both European and Eastern. A study of
these Oriental systems throws a strong
though often a false light upon the inner
meaning of Gnostic symbolism and ideas
generally, which Mr. King acknowledges
to have come from Indian sources; and
certainly the reader has a right to expect
a little more knowledge in that direction
from a writer of Mr. King’s pretensions,
than is displayed. For example, in the
section about Buddhism in the work before
us: one is tempted sometimes to ask
whether it is flippancy or superficiality
that is the matter with the author—when
he calls the ancient Indian
gymnosophists “fakirs,” and confounds
them with Buddhists. Surely he need
hardly be told that fakirs are Mahomedans,
and that the Gymnosophists he mentions
were Brahmin Yogis.</p>

<p class='c028'>The work, however, is a valuable one
in its way; but the reader should not
forget that “there seems reason for
suspecting” that the author does not
always know exactly what he is talking
about, whenever he strays too far from
Archæology, on which he is no doubt an
authority.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>THE JEWISH WORLD enters bravely
enough (in its issue of the 11th November
1887) on its new character of professor of
symbology and History. It accuses in no
measured terms one of the editors of
<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> of ignorance; and criticises
certain expressions used in our October
number, in a foot-note inserted to explain
why the “Son of the Morning” <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>
is called in Mr. G. Massey’s little poem,
“Lady of Light.” The writer objects, we
see, to Lucifer-Venus being called in one
of its aspects “the Jewish Astoreth;” or
to her having ever been offered cakes by
the Jews. As explained in a somewhat
confused sentence: “There <em>was no Jewish
Astoreth</em>, though the Syrian goddess,
Ashtoreth, or Astarte, often appears in
Biblical literature, the moon goddess, the
complement of Baal, the Sun God.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This, no doubt, is extremely learned
and conveys quite <em>new</em> information. Yet
such an astounding statement as that the
whole of the foot-note in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> is
“pure imagination and bad history” is
very risky indeed. For it requires no
more than a stroke or two of our pen to
make the whole edifice of this denial
tumble on the <cite>Jewish World</cite> and mangle
it very badly. Our contemporary has
evidently forgotten the wise proverb that
bids one to let “sleeping dogs lie,” and
therefore, it is with the lofty airs of
superiority that he informs his readers
that though the Jews in Palestine lived
surrounded with (? <i>sic</i>) this pagan form of
worship, and <em>may, at times</em>, (?!) have
wandered towards it, they <span class='sc'>had nothing
in their worship in common with
Chaldean or Syrian beliefs in multiplicity
of deities</span>? (!!)</p>

<p class='c028'>This is what any impartial reader
might really term “bad history,” and
every Bible worshipper describe as a <em>direct
lie</em> given to the Lord God of Israel. It is
more than <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>suppressio veri suggestio
falsi</i></span>, for it is simply a cool denial of facts
in the face of both Bible and History.
We advise our critic of the <cite>Jewish World</cite>
to turn to <em>his</em> own prophets, to Jeremiah,
foremost of all. We open “Scripture”
and find in it: “the Lord God” while
accusing <em>his</em> “backsliding Israel and
treacherous Judah” of following in “the
ways of Egypt and of Assyria,” of drinking
the waters of Sihor, and “serving
strange Gods” enumerating his grievances
in this wise:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“According <em>to the number of thy cities</em> are thy
gods, O Judah, (Jer. ii. 28.).</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ye have turned back to the iniquities of your
forefathers who went after other gods to serve
them (xi.) ... <em>according to the number of the
streets of Jerusalem</em> have ye set up altars to that
shameful thing, even altars unto <a id='corr333R.61'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Baal'>Baal”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_333R.61'><ins class='correction' title='Baal'>Baal”</ins></a></span> (<cite>Ib.</cite>).</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>So much for Jewish <em>monotheism</em>. And
is it any more “pure imagination” to say
that the Jews offered cakes to their
Astoreth and called her “Queen of
Heaven”? Then the “Lord God” must,
indeed, be guilty of more than “a delicate
expansion of facts” when thundering to,
and through, Jeremiah:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Seest thou not what they do in the cities of
Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? The
children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the
fire, and the women knead their dough <span class='fss'>TO MAKE
CAKES</span> <em>to the Queen of Heaven</em>, and to pour out
drink offerings <em>unto the gods</em>.” (Jer. vii. 17-18).</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>“The Jews <em>may</em> <span class='fss'>AT TIMES</span>” only (?) have
wandered towards pagan forms of worship
but “had <em>nothing in common</em> in it with
Syrian beliefs in multiplicity of deities.”
Had they not? Then the ancestors of the
editors of the <cite>Jewish World</cite> must have
been the victims of “suggestion,” when,
snubbing Jeremiah (and not entirely
without good reason),they declared to him:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“As for the word that thou hast spoken unto
us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken
unto thee. But we will certainly do whatsoever
thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn

have done, we</em>, <span class='fss'>AND OUR FATHERS</span>, <em>our kings, and
our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem</em>, for <em>then</em> had we plenty of
victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. But
<em>since we left off to burn incense to the Queen of
Heaven</em>, and to <em>pour out drink offerings unto her</em>
... and (<em>to</em>) <em>make her cakes to worship her ...
we have wanted all things</em>, and have been consumed
by the sword and by the <a id='corr334L.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='famine...’'>famine....”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_334L.29'><ins class='correction' title='famine...’'>famine....”</ins></a></span>
(Jer. xliv. 16, 17, 18, 19).</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Thus, according to their own confession,
it is not “at times” that the Jews made
cakes for, and worshipped Astoreth and
the strange gods, but constantly: doing,
moreover, <em>as their forefathers</em>, kings and
princes <em>did</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>“<em>Bad</em> history”? And what was the
“golden calf” but the sacred heifer, the
symbol of the “Great Mother,” first the
planet Venus, and then the moon? For
the esoteric doctrine holds (as the Mexicans
held) that Venus, the morning star,
was <em>created before the sun and moon; metaphorically</em>,
of course, not astronomically,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c013'><sup>[124]</sup></a>
the assumption being based upon, and
meaning that which the <em>Nazars</em> and the
Initiate alone understood among the Jews,
but that the writers of the <cite>Jewish World</cite>
are not supposed to know. For the same
reason the Chaldeans maintained that the
moon was produced before the sun (<em>see
Babylon—Account of Creation, by George
Smith</em>). The morning star, Lucifer-Venus
was dedicated to that Great Mother
symbolized by the heifer or the “Golden
Calf.” For, as says Mr. G. Massey in his
lecture on “The Hebrews and their Creations,”
“This (the Golden Calf) being of
either sex, it supplied a twin-type for
Venus, as Hathor or Ishtar (Astoreth), the
double star, that was male at rising, and
female at sunset” She is the “Celestial
Aphrodite,” <em>Venus Victrix</em> νιχηφόρος associated
with <em>Ares</em> (see Pausanias i, 8, 4,
11, 25, 1).</p>

<p class='c028'>We are told that “happily for them
(the Jews) there was no Jewish Astoreth.”
The <cite>Jewish World</cite> has yet to learn, we
see, that there would have been no Greek
Venus Aphrodite; no <em>Ourania</em>, her
earlier appellation; nor would she have
been confounded with the Assyrian
Mylitta (Herod, 1, 199; Pausan., 1, 14, 7;
Hesiod, Μυληταν την Ουρανιαν Ασσυριοι)
had it not been for the Phœnicians
and other Semites. We say the “Jewish
Astoreth,” and we maintain what we
say, on the authority of the Iliad,
the Odyssey, of Renan, and many
others. Venus Aphrodite is one with
the Astarte, Astoreth, etc. of the
Phœnicians, and she is one (as a planet)
with “Lucifer” the “Morning Star.” So
far back as the days of Homer, she was
confounded with <em>Kypris</em>, an Oriental
goddess brought by the Phœnician
Semites from their Asiatic travels (<cite>Iliad</cite>,
V, 330, 422, 260). Her worship appears
first at Cythere, a Phœnician settlement
depôt or trade-establishment (<cite>Odys.</cite>, VIII.
362.; Walcker, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>griech. götterl.</i></span> I, 666.)
Herodotus shows that the sanctuary of
Ascalon, in Syria, was the most ancient of
the fanes of Aphrodite Ourania (I, 105):
and Decharme tells us in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Mythologie
de la Grèce Antique</i></span>, that whenever the
Greeks alluded to the origin of Aphrodite
they designated her as <em>Ourania</em>, an epithet
translated from a <em>semitic word</em>, as Jupiter
<em>Epouranios</em> of the Phœnician inscriptions,
was the <em>Samemroum</em> of Philo of Byblos,
according to Renan (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Mission de Phenicie</i></span>).
Astoreth was a goddess of generation,
presiding at human birth (as Jehovah
was <em>god of generation</em>, foremost of all).
She was the moon-goddess, and a planet at
the same time, whose worship originated
with the Ph&oelig;nicians and Semites. It
flourished most in the Phœnician settlements
and colonies in Sicily, at Eryax. There
hosts of <em>Hetairae</em> were attached to her
temples, as hosts of <em>Kadeshim</em>, called by
a more sincere name in the Bible, were,
to the house of the Lord, <a id='corr334R.51'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='where'>“where</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_334R.51'><ins class='correction' title='where'>“where</ins></a></span> the women
wove hangings for the grove” (II. Kings,
xxiii, 7). All this shows well the Semitic
provenance of Astoreth-Venus in her
capacity of “great Mother.” Let us pause.
We advise sincerely the <cite>Jewish World</cite> to
abstain from throwing stones at other
peoples’ beliefs, so long as its own faith is
but a house of glass. And though Jeremy
Taylor may think that “to be proud of
one’s learning is the greatest ignorance,”
yet, in this case it is but simple justice to
say that it is really desirable for our friends
the Jews that the writer in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> of the
criticised note about Astoreth <em>should know
less</em> of history and the Bible, and her unlucky
critic in the <cite>Jewish World</cite> learn a
little more about it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c032'>THE THEOSOPHIST for October
opens with the first of a series of articles
on the “Elohistic Cosmogony.” The
views put forward by the writer are certainly
both striking and original, and,
although Dr. Pratt diverges very considerably
from the recognised standard of
kabalistic orthodoxy, his interpretation of
the Jewish version of cosmic evolution
will assuredly excite considerable interest.</p>

<p class='c028'>Following on Dr. Pratt’s learned
article, come a few—unfortunately, too
few—pages of extremely interesting notes
on the Folk-lore of the Himalayan tribes,
contributed by Captain Banon. The
<cite>Theosophist</cite> has often been indebted to
Captain Banon for similar notes respecting
such little known tribes and people;
and it is much to be regretted that the
many members of the Theosophical
Society who reside in or visit such out-of-the-way
places, do not make it a rule to
collect these traditions and send them for
publication in the <cite>Theosophist</cite> or one of
the other Theosophical magazines.</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Hartmann continues his series of
“Rosicrucian Letters,” with a number of
extracts from the papers of Karl von
Eckartshausen, who died in 1792. Dr.
Hartmann deserves the gratitude of all
students for rendering accessible these
records and notes of past generations of
“seekers after the Truth.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Dr. Buck contributes a pithy and
thoughtful article on “The Soul Problem,”
and Mr. Lazarus continues his exposition
of the kabalistic doctrine of the Microcosm.
Besides these there are further
instalments of two valuable translations
from Hindu works of great antiquity and
authority; the “Crest Jewel of Wisdom,”
by Sankaracharya and the <a id='corr335L.44'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Kaivalyanita.”'>“Kaivalyanita.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_335L.44'><ins class='correction' title='Kaivalyanita.”'>“Kaivalyanita.”</ins></a></span>
It is much to be desired that one of our
Hindu brothers, who adds to a knowledge
of his own mystic literature, an acquaintance
with Western modes of thought and
expression, would devote a series
of articles to the exposition of the
fundamental standpoint and ideas of such
works as these. Such an article would
add enormously to the value of these
translations to the Western world.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the <cite>November</cite> number, Dr. Pratt
takes up the <em>Jehovistic</em> cosmogony, which
he contrasts and compares with the <em>Elohistic</em>
version already referred to. In his
view, the Jehovistic teaching embodies
the conception of the world as “created”
and “ruled” by an <em>extra-natural</em> and
<em>personal</em> deity, as opposed to the more
philosophical and pantheistic conception
of the earlier Elohistic writers.</p>

<p class='c028'>Under the title of <cite>An Ancient Weapon</cite>,
this issue contains an instructive account
of the evocation of certain astral forces
according to the ancient Vedic rites. As
here described, the <em>evil intention</em>, with
which the rite is performed, transforms it
into a ceremony of <em>Black Magic</em>, but
this does not render the account any less
valuable.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is followed by the first of a series
of articles on <cite>The Allegory of the Zoroastrian
Cosmogony</cite>, which promises to
furnish much food for thought and study.</p>

<p class='c028'><cite>Rosicrucian Letters</cite> contains this time
an extract from an old MS., headed <cite>The
Temple of Solomon</cite>, which is well worthy
of careful attention.</p>

<p class='c028'>Besides these we have a sketch of the
life and writings of Madvachary, the great
teacher of Southern India, and some
further testimonies to the fact of “self-levitation”
from eye-witnesses. Rama
Prasad gives some most valuable details
of the “Science of Breathing,” one of the
most curious branches of occult physics,
while the remainder of the number is
occupied by an article on “Tetragrammaton,”
which may be interesting to students
of the Kabbala, and continuations of the
“Kabbala and the Microcosm,” and of the
translations from Indian books mentioned
in connection with the October number.</p>

<p class='c028'>These two numbers contain much valuable
matter and well maintain the reputation
which the <cite>Theosophist</cite> originally
gained for itself.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>In THE PATH for October we notice
especially the following articles:</p>

<p class='c028'><cite>Nature’s Scholar</cite>, a most poetically-conceived
and well-worked-out Idyll, by
J. C. Ver Plank, in which the underlying
occult truth is presented to the reader in
a most attractive form.</p>

<p class='c028'>Following this is a much needed warning
against the dangers of <em>Astral Intoxication</em>.
Admirably expressed, it points out
the true, and indicates the false, path
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>with great clearness; and we desire to
call the earnest attention of such of our
readers as are engaged in <em>psychic</em> development
to its importance.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Pilgrim” contributes some further
<em>Thoughts in Solitude</em>, the leading idea of
which may be indicated by its concluding
lines, which are quoted from Sir Philip
Sydney of heroic fame:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>

      <div class='line'>“Then farewell, World! thy uttermost I see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'><cite>Tea-Table Talk</cite> is even more interesting
and suggestive than usual, and, besides
those above mentioned, this well-filled
number contains Part IV. of the series
of articles on <cite>The Poetry of Re-incarnation
in Western Literature</cite>, which
deals with the <em>Platonic Poets</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>The <cite>November</cite> number opens with an
able continuation of Mr. Brehon’s article
on <cite>The Bhagavat-Gita</cite>, commenced so
long ago as last April, of which we hope
to peruse a further instalment. Following
this is a short article indicating the term
“Medium” from the loathsome connotations
which phenomenal spiritualism has
attached to it. We then come to a paper
on Goethe’s <cite>Faust</cite>, read before one
of the branches of the Theosophical
Society in America. It is of great interest
to students of literature and will furnish a
clue to the real meaning of much of the
poet’s writing.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Johnston makes some most suggestive
remarks on <cite>Cain and Abel</cite>;
Harij speaks in no uncertain tones of
<em>Personalities</em> and Truth, while Hadji
Erinn points out the <em>Path of Action</em>, and
warns the members of the T. S. that they
must not expect their road to become
easier and plainer before them, while yet
the society is undergoing the trials of its
education.</p>

<p class='c028'>Zadok gives some able answers to
questions on various points of practical
occultism and Julius, in <cite>Tea-Table Talk</cite>,
points out how many people are really
entering on the path of Theosophy—even
though unconsciously.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'>LE LOTUS, for October and November,
is even more interesting than usual.
In the October number are contained two
very valuable articles. The first of these
is a paper on Paracelsus from the pen of
Dr. Hartmann, who is especially qualified
to handle the subject by his profound
study of the work, and especially the
manuscripts, of that great occultist. M.
“Papus” contributes a most lucid and
able exposition of some Kabbalistic
doctrines, the <em>practical</em> value of which
has been hitherto but little realised even
by professed students of mysticism.</p>

<p class='c028'>The opening article in the November
issue is headed, <cite>The Constitution of the
Microcosm</cite>. It is written in a clear and
attractive style, and contains a most
thorough and complete explanation of the
various classifications of the principles
which enter into the constitution of man.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Amaravella” has evidently studied the
whole subject very deeply, and he shows
the relation of these various classifications
to one another in a way which
will clear up many of the misconceptions
which have arisen.</p>

<p class='c028'>M. “Papus” writes on Alchemy in a
manner which shows how conversant he
is with this little-understood topic. We
therefore look forward with great anticipations to
the perusal of his book “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Traité
élémentaire de science occulte</cite></span>,” the
fourth chapter of which contains the
article referred to.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is very evident that Theosophy is
making great and rapid progress in
France, and this is in great measure due
to the untiring and unselfish devotion of
the editor of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Le Lotus</i></span>, M. Gaboriau,
whom we congratulate most warmly on
the success which has attended his
efforts.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c028'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>L’Aurore</cite></span> for October contains an
article on the so-called “Star of Bethlehem,”
which repeats the assurance that
the world is entering on a new and happier
life-phase.</p>

<p class='c028'>Unfortunately, it seems more than
probable that before this amelioration takes
place, the world must pass through the
valley of the shadow of Death, and endure
calamities far worse than any it has yet
seen. Lady Caithness continues her
erudite and interesting article on the lost
ten tribes of Israel. Her thesis is put
forward in admirable language, and supported
by a great wealth of biblical quotations.
Unfortunately, the task undertaken
is an impossible one. There never were
twelve tribes of Israel—two only—Judah
and the Levites, having had a real existence
in the flesh. The remainder are but
euhemerizations of the signs of the Zodiac,
and were introduced because they were
necessary to the Kabalistic scheme on
which the “History” of the Jews was
written.</p>

<p class='c028'>Lady Barrogill relates the well-known
story of an English bishop and the ghost
of a Catholic priest, who haunted his
former residence in order to secure the
destruction of some notes he had taken
(contrary to the rule of the Church) of an
important confession which he had heard.</p>

<p class='c028'>Besides these articles we find the continuation
of the serial romance, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’amour
Immortel,</span>” and <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> has to thank
the editor for the appreciative notice contained
in this number.</p>

It is, after all, a relative matter to the capacities and potentialities of the individual and his surroundings.
Under Socialism, sensuality, social or plutocratic pride, and other sins fostered by the
present order, would simply give way to ambition (to obtain popular distinction, <i>e.g.</i>, as an artist or
inventor) and perhaps to magic and other at present unfashionable vices.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r66'>66</a>. It is somewhat difficult to follow the argument of this passage, unless the meaning of the words
is explained. The Lion of the House of Judah is equivalent to “the Lord” and to “the Victor”
mentioned below. In the writer’s phraseology “Victor is the symbol of the Trinity of Wisdom, Love,
Truth.” Now the Lion is symbolical of Wisdom; but, as it is impossible to sever one element of the
Trinity from another, it is necessary to remember that whenever the word wisdom is used it carries
with it the other two as well. The above sentence would then seem to mean the conjunction of the
male and female principles to effect the purpose of the manifestation of the Trinity above mentioned;
by which manifestation all ignorance is dispelled. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f67'>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. “And no man can say <em>Jesus is Lord</em> (<i>i.e.</i> Victor), but in the Holy Spirit.”—(1 Corinthians xii., 3,
Revised Version.) It is especially necessary to remember that whenever allusion is made to Victoria, it
is not Her Most Gracious Majesty who is meant but the unseen Victoria whose outward manifestation
the Queen is alleged to be. It is as though the Queen is the mouth-piece of the intelligence behind,
as the Foreign Secretary may be the mouth-piece of the Foreign policy of the Government. The
language used is purely symbolical and by using words as symbols an esoteric meaning is attached
to the most commonplace events in life. It is a truly occult argument, but one which matter-of-fact
people will regard as nonsensical. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. According to the explanations of the writer (<i>v. supra</i>), <em>The World</em> signifies a state of ignorance

<p class='c028'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. To say that Man was created ignorant for a great purpose would argue the idea of a creator,
according to orthodox ideas. But the writer is known to repudiate this idea entirely. It is difficult,
therefore, to see what he means, unless it is that the man of flesh was ushered into existence by an
evolution which he has not yet completed—ignorant, to acquire knowledge gradually. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. This is a <em>very</em> optimistic view of the case, and we can only hope to see it realised. The article
“Signs of the Times” agrees with the views of the writer of this article. There is a development
going on, but the forces against which it has to contend are too dense for an early realisation of this
dreamlike Golden Age. It is too good to be true; but that it is possible to help it is also true. The
Kingdom of Heaven may be taken by violence, and an entrance effected in an instant, but the process
of attaining the position whence the attack may be delivered, is one extending over years. No student
of occultism needs to be told this. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. David means <em>beloved</em>; he was the first King of Israel, chosen of the Spirit. Israel means <em>one
who strives with God</em>—<i>i.e.</i> one who strives against ignorance in order that he may be blessed together
with his posterity. It was a name given to Jacob when he wrestled with the Angel (Genesis xxxii., 28),
and applies <em>to all</em> who contend on the side of the Deity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. In the writer’s phraseology, Judah is the equivalent of Erin in this case. It becomes exceedingly
difficult to follow his meaning, for as everything is the equivalent of everything else, we are landed in
a hopeless maze of paradox. On the principle that there is no truth without a paradox, there must
be a great truth in this article (as there is), but its disentanglement is a matter of much labour and
thought. The line of argument is the Judah meaning “be praised”—certain people who praised or
followed the Lord (or Wisdom) were “oppressed and laid aside <em>their harps</em>.” There are people unjustly
oppressed in Ireland, not by the outer troubles, but by the causes of the undoubted misery
which prevails there. Consequently, the daughters of Judah and Erin are equivalent terms and
interchangeable as symbols. The fact is that the author uses a peculiar cryptogram, as he himself
states. [<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. In his recent work—“The Early Days of Christianity,” Canon Farrar remarks:—“Some have
supposed a pleasant play of words founded on it, as ... between <em>Chréstos</em> (‘sweet’ Ps. xxx., iv., 8)
and Christos (Christ)” (I. p. 158, <em>foot-note</em>). But there is nothing to suppose, since it <a id='corr299.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='begun'>began</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_299.29'><ins class='correction' title='begun'>began</ins></a></span> by a
“play of words,” indeed. The name <em>Christus</em> was <em>not</em> “distorted into Chrestus,” as the learned
author would make his readers believe (p. 19), but it was the adjective and noun <em>Chréstos</em> which
became distorted into <em>Christus</em>, and applied to Jesus. In a foot-note on the word “Chrestian,”
occurring in the First Epistle of Peter (chap. iv., 16), in which in the <em>revised</em> later MSS. the word was
changed into <em>Christian</em>, Canon Farrar remarks again, “Perhaps we should read the ignorant heathen
distortion, <em>Chréstian</em>.” Most decidedly we should; for the eloquent writer should remember his
Master’s command to render unto Cæsar that which is Cæsar’s. His dislike notwithstanding, Mr.
Farrar is obliged to admit that the name <em>Christian</em> was first <span class='fss'>INVENTED</span>, by the sneering, mocking
Antiochians, as early as A.D. 44, but had not come into general use before the persecution by Nero.
“Tacitus,” he says, “uses the word Christians with something of apology. It is well known that in
the N. T. it only occurs three times, and always involves a hostile sense (<cite>Acts</cite> xi. 26, xxvi. 28, as it
does in iv. 16).” It was not Claudius alone who looked with alarm and suspicion on the Christians,
so nicknamed in derision for their carnalizing a subjective principle or attribute, but all the pagan
nations. For Tacitus, speaking of those whom the masses called “Christians,” describes them as a
set of men <em>detested for their enormities</em> and crimes. No wonder, for history repeats itself. There
are, no doubt, thousands of noble, sincere, and virtuous <em>Christian-born</em> men and women now. But
we have only to look at the viciousness of Christian “heathen” converts; at the <em>morality</em> of those
proselytes in India, whom the missionaries themselves decline to take into their service, to draw a
parallel between the converts of 1,800 years ago, and the modern heathens “touched <em>by grace</em>.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Lactantius, Clemens Alexandrinus, and others spelt it in this way.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f88'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r88'>88</a>. <i>Vide</i> Liddell and Scott’s Greek and English Lexicon. <em>Chréstos</em> is really one who is
continually warned, advised, guided, whether by oracle or prophet. Mr. G. Massey is not correct in
saying that “... The Gnostic form of the name Chrest, or Chrestos, denotes the <em>Good
God</em>, not a human original,” for it denoted the latter, <i>i.e.</i>, a good, holy man; but he is quite right
when he adds that “<em>Chrestianus</em> signifies ... ‘Sweetness and Light.’” “The <em>Chrestoi</em>, as the
<em>Good People</em>, were pre-extant. Numerous Greek inscriptions show that the departed, the hero,
the saintly one—that is, the ‘Good’—was styled <em>Chrestos</em>, or the Christ; and from this meaning of
the ‘Good’ does Justin, the primal apologist, derive the Christian name. This identifies it with the
Gnostic source, and with the ‘Good God’ who revealed himself according to Marcion—that is, the
Un-Nefer or Good-opener of the Egyptian theology.”—(<cite>Agnostic Annual.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r89'>89</a>. Again I must bring forward what Mr. G. Massey says (whom I quote repeatedly because he has
studied this subject so thoroughly and so conscientiously).</p>

<p class='c028'>“My contention, or rather explanation,” he says, “is that the author of the Christian name is the
Mummy-Christ of Egypt, called the <em>Karest</em>, which was a type of the immortal spirit in man, the
Christ within (as Paul has it), the divine offspring incarnated, the Logos, the Word of Truth, <a id='corr301.1.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='th'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_301.1.5'><ins class='correction' title='th'>the</ins></a></span>
<em>Makheru</em> of Egypt. It did not originate as a mere type!

of any one</em> that was <em>Karest</em>, or mummified, to be kept by the living; and, through constant repetition,
this became a type of the resurrection from (not of!) the dead.” See the explanation of this
further on.</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r90'>90</a>. Or Lydda. Reference is made here to the Rabbinical tradition in the Babylonian Gemara, called
<em>Sepher Toledoth Jeshu</em>, about Jesus being the son of one named Pandira, and having lived a century
earlier than the era called Christian, namely, during the reign of the Jewish king Alexander Jannæus
and his wife Salome, who reigned from the year 106 to 79 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Accused by the Jews of having
learned the magic art in Egypt, and of having stolen from the Holy of Holies the Incommunicable
Name, Jehoshua (Jesus) was put to death by the Sanhedrin at Lud. He was stoned and then crucified
on a tree, on the eve of Passover. The narrative is ascribed to the Talmudistic authors of “Sota”
and “Sanhedrin,” p. 19, Book of Zechiel. See “Isis Unveiled,” II. 201; Arnobius; Elephas Levi’s

Antiochians.... It is clear that the sacred writers avoided the name (Christians) because it was
employed by their enemies (Tac. Ann. xv. 44). It only became familiar when the virtues of
Christians had shed lustre upon it....” This is a very lame excuse, and a poor explanation to give
for so eminent a thinker as Canon Farrar. As to the “virtues of Christians” ever shedding <em>lustre</em>
upon the name, let us hope that the writer had in his mind’s eye neither Bishop Cyril, of Alexandria,

<p class='c028'><a href='#r93'>93</a>. In the days of Homer, we find this city, once celebrated for its mysteries, the chief seat of Initiation,
and the name of <em>Chrestos</em> used as a title during the mysteries. It is mentioned in the <cite>Iliad</cite>, ii., 520
as “Chrisa” (χρῖσα). Dr. Clarke suspected its ruins under the present site of <em>Krestona</em>, a small
town, or village rather, in Phocis, near the Crissæan Bay. (See E. D. Clarke, 4th ed. Vol. viii.

<p class='c028'><a href='#r94'>94</a>. The root of χρητός (<em>Chretos</em>) and χρηστος (<em>Chrestos</em>) is one and the same; χράω which means
“consulting the oracle,” in one sense, but in another one “consecrated,” <em>set apart</em>, belonging to
some temple, or oracle, or devoted to <a id='corr303.2.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='oraculer'>oracular</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_303.2.3'><ins class='correction' title='oraculer'>oracular</ins></a></span> services.

means “obligation,” a “bond, duty,” or one who is under the obligation of pledges, or vows
taken.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f95'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. The adjective χρηστὸς was also used as an adjective before proper names as a compliment, as

<div class='footnote' id='f96'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. There are strange features, quite suggestive, for an Occultist, in the myth (if one) of Janus.
Some make of him the personification of <em>Kosmos</em>, others, of <em>Cælus</em> (heaven), hence he is “two-faced”
because of his two characters of spirit and matter; and he is not only “Janus <em>Bifrons</em>” (two-faced),
but also <em>Quadrifrons</em>—the perfect square, the emblem of the Kabbalistic Deity. His temples were
built with <em>four</em> equal sides, with a door and <em>three</em> windows on each side. Mythologists explain it as
an emblem of the <em>four</em> seasons of the year, and <em>three</em> months in each season, and in all of the twelve
months of the year. During the mysteries of Initiation, however, he became the Day-Sun and the
Night-Sun. Hence he is often represented with the number 300 in one hand, and in the other 65, or
the number of days of the Solar year. Now <em>Chanoch</em> (Kanoch and <em>Enosh</em> in the Bible) is, as may
be shown on Kabalistic authority, whether son of Cain, son of Seth, or the son of Methuselah, one
and the same personage. As <em>Chanoch</em> (according to Fuerst), he is the <em>Initiator</em>, <em>Instructor</em>—of the
astronomical circle and solar <a id='corr303.4.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>year,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_303.4.12'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>year,”</ins></a></span> as son of Methuselah, who is said to have lived 365 years and been
taken to heaven alive, as the representative of the Sun (or god). (See Book of Enoch.) This patriarch
has many features in common with Janus, who, exoterically, is Ion but <span class='sc'>Iao</span> cabalistically, or Jehovah,
the “Lord God of Generations,” the mysterious Yodh, or <span class='sc'>One</span> (a phallic number). For Janus or Ion
is also <em>Consivius, a conserendo</em>, because he presided over generations. He is shown giving hospitality
to Saturn (<em>Chronos</em> “time”), and is the <em>Initiator</em> of the year, or time divided into 365.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. <em>Stauros</em> became the cross, the instrument of crucifixion, far later, when it began to be represented
as a Christian symbol and with the Greek letter T, the Tau. (Luc. Jud. Voc.) Its primitive meaning was
phallic, a symbol for the male and female elements; the great serpent of temptation, the body which
had to be killed or subdued by the dragon of wisdom, the seven-vowelled solar chnouphis or Spirit of
Christos of the Gnostics, or, again, Apollo killing Python.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. Even to this day in India, the candidate loses his name and, as also in Masonry, his age
(monks and nuns also changing their Christian names at their taking the order or veil), and begins
counting his years from the day he is accepted a chela and enters upon the cycle of initiations. Thus
Saul was “a child of one year,” when he began to reign, though a grown-up adult. See 1 Samuel
ch. xiii. 1, and Hebrew scrolls, about his initiation by Samuel.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r99'>99</a>. Demosthenes, “De Corona,” 313, declares that the candidates for <a id='corr305.2.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='intitiation'>initiation</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_305.2.1'><ins class='correction' title='intitiation'>initiation</ins></a></span> into the Greek
mysteries were anointed with oil. So they are now in India, even in the initiation into the <em>Yogi</em>
mysteries—various ointments or unguents being used.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f101'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r101'>101</a>. Hence the memorialising of the doctrine during the <span class='fss'>MYSTERIES</span>. The pure monad, the “god”
incarnating and becoming <em>Chrestos</em>, or man, on his trial of life, a series of those trials led him to the
<em>crucifixion of flesh</em>, and finally into the Christos condition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f102'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r102'>102</a>. On the best authority the derivation of the Greek <em>Christos</em> is shown from the Sanskrit root
<em>ghársh</em> = “rub”; thus: <i>ghársh-ā-mi-to</i>, “to rub,” and ghársh-tá-s “flayed, sore.” Moreover, Krish,
which means in one sense to plough and make furrows, means also to cause pain, “to torture to
torment,” and ghrsh-tā-s “rubbing”—all these terms relating to Chrestos and Christos conditions.
One has <em>to die in Chrestos</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, kill one’s personality and its passions, to blot out every idea of
separateness from one’s “Father,” the Divine Spirit in man; to become one with the eternal and absolute
<em>Life</em> and <em>Light</em> (<span class='sc'>Sat</span>) before one can reach the glorious state of <em>Christos</em>, the regenerated man, the
man in spiritual freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f103'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r103'>103</a>. The Orientalists and Theologians are invited to read over and study the allegory of Viswakarman,
the “Omnificent,” the Vedic God, the architect of the world, who sacrificed himself <em>to himself</em> or the
world, after having offered up all worlds, <em>which are himself</em>, in a “Sarva Madha” (general sacrifice)—and
ponder over it. In the Purânic allegory, his daughter <em>Yoga-siddha</em> “Spiritual consciousness,”
the wife of <em>Surya</em>, the Sun, complains to him of the too great effulgence of her husband; and Viswakarmâ,
in his character of <em>Takshaka</em>, “wood cutter and carpenter,” placing the Sun upon his lathe cuts
away a part of his brightness. Surya looks, after this, crowned with dark thorns instead of rays, and
becomes Vikarttana (“shorn of his rays”). All these names are terms which were used by the candidates
when going through the trials of Initiation. The Hierophant-Initiator personated Viswakarman; the
father, and the general <em>artificer</em> of the gods (the adepts on earth), and the candidate-Surya, the
Sun, who had to kill all his fiery passions and wear the crown of thorns <em>while crucifying his body</em>
before he could rise and be re-born into a new life as the glorified “Light of the World”—Christos.
No Orientalist seems to have ever perceived the suggestive analogy, let alone to apply it!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f104'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r104'>104</a>. The author of the “Source of Measures” thinks that this “serves to explain why it has been that
the <em>Life of Apollonius of Tyana, by Philostratus</em> has been so carefully kept back from translation and
popular reading.” Those who have studied it in the original have been forced to the comment that
either the “<cite>Life of Apollonius</cite> has been taken from the New Testament, or that New Testament
narratives have been taken from the <cite>Life of Apollonius</cite>, because of the manifest sameness of the
<em>means of construction</em> of the narrative.” (p. 260).</p>

As a noun, <em>place of thorns, pit</em>. The <em>hifil</em> participle of this word is [Hebrew] or Messiach, or the Greek
<em>Messias</em>, <em>Christ</em>, and means “he who causes to go down into the pit” (or hell, in dogmatism). In
esoteric philosophy, this going down <em>into the pit</em> has the most mysterious significance. The Spirit
“Christos” or rather the “Logos” (<em>read</em> Logoï), is said to “go down into the pit,” when it incarnates
in flesh, <em>is born as a man</em>. After having robbed the <em>Elohim</em> (or gods) of their secret, the <em>pro-creating</em>
“fire of life,” the Angels of Light are shown cast down into the pit or abyss of matter, called <em>Hell</em>, or
the bottomless pit, by the kind theologians. This, in Cosmogony and Anthropology. During the
Mysteries, however, it is the <em>Chréstos</em>, <em>neophyte</em>, (as man), etc., who had to descend into the crypts
of Initiation and trials; and finally, during the “Sleep of Siloam” or the final <em>trance</em> condition,
during the hours of which the new Initiate has the last and final mysteries of being divulged to him.
Hades, Schéol, or Patala, are all one. The same takes place in the East now, as took place 2,000
years ago in the West, during the <span class='sc'>Mysteries</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f106'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r106'>106</a>. Several classics bear testimony to this fact. Lucian, c. 16, says Φωκίων ὁ χρηστὸς, and Φωκίων
ὁ ἐπὶκλην (<a id='corr310.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='λεγόμενος,”'>“λεγόμενος,”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_310.19'><ins class='correction' title='λεγόμενος,”'>“λεγόμενος,”</ins></a></span> surnamed “χρηστος.”) In Phædr. p. 226 E, it is written, “you mean
Theodorus the Chrestos.” “Τὸν χρηστὸν λεγεις Θεὸδωρον”. Plutarch shows the same; and Χρηστος—Chrestus,
is the proper name (see the word in <cite>Thesaur.</cite> Steph.) of an orator and disciple of Herodes
Atticus.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f107'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r107'>107</a>. Mr. Keightley’s meaning (and it is difficult for the words to bear any other interpretation) was
that the denial of harmony is evidence that, at some previous time, the man who denies has set himself
in opposition to the law, in virtue of those very desires and instincts of his animal personality to
which Mr. Beatty alludes later on. In this sense, Mr. Beatty is right in saying that a law of the
universe cannot be broken; but its limits may be transgressed, and consequently an attempt made by
man to make himself into a small, but rival universe. It is the old story of the china pot and the
iron kettle, and the fact that china gets the worst of it is conclusive that the china is struggling <em>against</em>
Nature.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f108'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r108'>108</a>. Will Mr. Beatty explain the phenomenon of a comet flirting its tail round the sun in defiance of
the “<em>law</em> of gravitation”?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f109'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r109'>109</a>. Very little doubt that it does. Mankind is only very gradually developing its fifth sense on the
intellectual plane. Intuition might have carried our critic over the difficulty, but in some parts of
his criticism he seems hardly to have begun to evolute the intellectual sense.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f110'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r110'>110</a>. “This Karma,” as Mr. Beatty expresses it, would not be quite so bewildering a subject if critics
would bear in mind the context and not fall foul of a detached expression—not even a sentence. The
“interest of the soul’s welfare in heaven” is concentrated by John Smith on John Smith as John Smith
in heaven, and in order that the said John Smith may go on enjoying the things he loved on earth.
As his earth life has ended, John Smith has changed and is “transient.” If he were not transient
a very natural inference would follow, that progress, evolution, &amp;c., on whatever plane of being does
not prevail.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f111'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r111'>111</a>. Mr. Beatty hardly maintains his position of consistent materialism here; and it is at least as
vainglorious to deny as to assert.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f112'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r112'>112</a>. Man has the “animal” in him of course, but he has also the power of judgment or discrimination.
Mr. Beatty’s wish to be critically pessimistic seems here to run away with his power of discrimination.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f113'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r113'>113</a>. No law of Nature can be set aside, but a man <em>transgresses</em> a law of his [mental] being when he
deliberately places himself under the sway of certain “evil” forces. The gist of Mr. Beatty’s
criticism is not quite evident here.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f114'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r114'>114</a>. The <em>phenomenal</em> contrast is not denied, but it is representative of no fundamental want of
harmony. In the same way the contrast of Subject and Object is essential to our present finite
consciousness, although it has no basis of reality beyond the limits of conditional being. Moreover,
even in this phenomenal Universe, equilibrium (harmony) is most certainly maintained by the very
conflict of the contrasted forces alluded to.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f115'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r115'>115</a>. Mr. Beatty asks how the Universe would come to a stand-still, if the law of Harmony was
suspended. Now suppose, for instance, the law of “gravity” was not <em>counterbalanced</em> by the action
of other “forces,” what would happen? Science assures us that everything would have long before
gravitated to a common centre, and a universal dead-lock have ensued! <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Vice versa</i></span>, if “gravity”
were to lapse. <cite>Verb. Sap.</cite></p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r116'>116</a>. Yet, unless <em>metaphysical</em> speculation comes to the rescue of the new philosophy, and, completing,

<p class='c028'><a href='#r117'>117</a>. We know but two cases of <em>married</em> “chelas” being accepted; but both these were Brahmins and
had <em>child-wives</em>, according to Hindu custom, and they were <em>Reformers</em> more than <em>chelas</em>, trying to abrogate
child-marriage and slavery. Others had to obtain the consent of their wives before entering the
“Path,” as is usual in India since long ages.</p>

generous promise to furnish “investigators of the
same order” as the supposed “Sibyl,” with “a
still more profound theosophy.” This is extremely
considerate and kind. But if it is <em>Pistis-Sophia</em>
which the author had in his mind, then he
had better apply to Theosophists for the explanation
of the most recondite points in that gnostic
fragment, while translating it, as he proposes
doing from Latin. For though the world of the
Orientalists “of the same order” as <em>himself</em>, may
labour under the mistaken impression that no
one except themselves knew or know anything
about <em>Pistis-Sophia</em> till 1853—Theosophists know
better. Does Mr. King really imagine that no
one besides himself knows anything about the
Gnostics “and their remains,” or what <em>he</em> knows
is the only correct thing to know? Strange
delusion, if so; yet quite a harmless one, we
confess.</p>

<p class='c032'>People usually wish that their friends shall have a happy new
year, and sometimes “prosperous” is added to “happy.” It is
not likely that much happiness or prosperity can come to those
who are living for the truth under such a dark number as 1888; but
still the year is heralded by the glorious star Venus-Lucifer, shining so
resplendently that it has been mistaken for that still rarer visitor, the
star of Bethlehem. This too, is at hand; and surely something of the
Christos spirit must be born upon earth under such conditions. Even if
happiness and prosperity are absent, it is possible to find something
greater than either in this coming year. Venus-Lucifer is the sponsor
of our magazine, and as we chose to come to light under its auspices, so
do we desire to touch on its nobility. This is possible for us all
personally, and instead of wishing our readers a happy or prosperous
New Year, we feel more in the vein to pray them to make it one worthy
of its brilliant herald. This can be effected by those who are courageous
and resolute. Thoreau pointed out that there are artists in life, persons
who can change the colour of a day and make it beautiful to those with
whom they come in contact. We claim that there are adepts, masters
in life who make it divine, as in all other arts. Is it not the greatest art
of all, this which affects the very atmosphere in which we live? That
it is the most important is seen at once, when we remember that every
person who draws the breath of life affects the mental and moral
atmosphere of the world, and helps to colour the day for those about
him. Those who do not help to elevate the thoughts and lives of others
must of necessity either paralyse them by indifference, or actively drag
them down. When this point is reached, then the art of life is converted
into the science of death; we see the black magician at work. And no
one can be quite inactive. Although many bad books and pictures are
produced, still not everyone who is incapable of writing or painting well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>insists on doing so badly. Imagine the result if they were to! Yet so
it is in life. Everyone lives, and thinks, and speaks. If all our readers
who have any sympathy with <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> endeavoured to learn the art
of making life not only beautiful but divine, and vowed no longer to be
hampered by disbelief in the possibility of this miracle, but to commence
the Herculean task at once, then 1888, however unlucky a year, would
have been fitly ushered in by the gleaming star. Neither happiness nor
prosperity are always the best of bedfellows for such undeveloped
mortals as most of us are; they seldom bring with them peace, which is
the only permanent joy. The idea of peace is usually connected with
the close of life and a religious state of mind. That kind of peace will
however generally be found to contain the element of expectation. The
pleasures of this world have been surrendered, and the soul waits
contentedly in expectation of the pleasures of the next. The peace of
the philosophic mind is very different from this and can be attained to
early in life when pleasure has scarcely been tasted, as well as when it
has been fully drunk of. The American Transcendentalists discovered
that life could be made a sublime thing without any assistance from
circumstances or outside sources of pleasure and prosperity. Of course
this had been discovered many times before, and Emerson only took up
again the cry raised by Epictetus. But every man has to discover this
fact freshly for himself, and when once he has realised it he knows that
he would be a wretch if he did not endeavour to make the possibility a
reality in his own life. The stoic became sublime because he recognised
his own absolute responsibility and did not try to evade it; the Transcendentalist
was even more, because he had faith in the unknown and
untried possibilities which lay within himself. The occultist fully
recognises the responsibility and claims his title by having both tried
and acquired knowledge of his own possibilities. The Theosophist who
is at all in earnest, sees his responsibility and endeavours to find knowledge,
living, in the meantime, up to the highest standard of which he is
aware. To all such <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> gives greeting! Man’s life is in his own
hands, his fate is ordered by himself. Why then should not 1888 be a
year of greater spiritual development than any we have lived through?
It depends on ourselves to make it so. This is an actual fact, not a
religious sentiment. In a garden of sunflowers every flower turns
towards the light. Why not so with us?</p>

<p class='c028'>And let no one imagine that it is a mere fancy, the attaching of
importance to the birth of the year. The earth passes through its
definite phases and man with it; and as a day can be coloured so can a
year. The astral life of the earth is young and strong between
Christmas and Easter. Those who form their wishes now will have
added strength to fulfil them consistently.</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>“TO THE READERS OF ‘LUCIFER.’”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c032'>Our magazine is only four numbers old, and already its young life
is full of cares and trouble. This is all as it should be; <i>i.e.</i>, like
every other publication, it must fail to satisfy <em>all</em> its readers, and
this is only in the nature of things and the destiny of every printed organ.
But what seems a little strange in a country of culture and freethought
is that <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> should receive such a number of <em>anonymous</em>, spiteful,
and often abusive letters. This, of course, is but a casual remark, the
waste-basket in the office being the only addressee and sufferer in this
case; yet it suggests strange truths with regard to human nature.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c013'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>Sincerity is true wisdom, it appears, only to the mind of the moral
philosopher. It is rudeness and insult to him who regards dissimulation
and deceit as culture and politeness, and holds that the shortest, easiest,
and safest way to success is to let sleeping dogs and old customs alone.
But, if the dogs are obstructing the highway to progress and truth, and
Society will, as a rule, reject the wise words of (St.) Augustine, who
recommends that “no man should prefer custom before reason and
truth,” is it a sufficient cause for the philanthropist to walk out of, or
even deviate from, the track of truth, because the selfish egoist chooses
to do so? Very true, as remarked somewhere by Sir Thomas Browne
that not every man is a proper champion for the truth, nor fit  to take
up the gauntlet in its cause. Too many of such defenders are apt, from
inconsideration and too much zeal, to charge the troops of error so
rashly that they “remain themselves as trophies to the enemies of truth.”
Nor ought all of us (members of the Theosophical Society) to do
so personally, but rather leave it only to those among our numbers
who have voluntarily and beforehand sacrificed their personalities
for the cause of Truth. Thus teaches us one of the Masters of Wisdom
in some fragments of advice which are published further on for the
benefit of the Theosophists (see the article that follows this). While
enforcing upon such public characters in our ranks as editors, and
lecturers, etc., the duty of telling fearlessly “the Truth to the face of <span class='fss'>LIE</span>,”
he yet condemns the habit of private judgment and criticism in every
individual Theosophist.</p>

<p class='c028'>Unfortunately, these are not the ways of the public and readers.
Since our journal is entirely unsectarian, since it is neither theistic
nor atheistic, Pagan nor Christian, orthodox nor heterodox, therefore, its
editors discover eternal verities in the most opposite religious systems
and modes of thought. Thus <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> fails to give full satisfaction to
either infidel or Christian. In the sight of the former—whether he be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>an Agnostic, a Secularist, or an Idealist—to find divine or occult lore
underlying “the rubbish” in the Jewish Bible and Christian Gospels is
sickening; in the opinion of the latter, to recognise the same truth as in
the Judeo-Christian Scriptures in the Hindu, Parsi, Buddhist, or
Egyptian religious literature, is vexation of spirit and blasphemy.
Hence, fierce criticism from both sides, sneers and abuse. Each party
would have us on its own sectarian side, recognising as truth, only that
which its particular <em>ism</em> does.</p>

<p class='c028'>But this cannot nor shall it be. Our motto was from the first, and ever
shall be: “<span class='sc'>There is no Religion higher than—Truth</span>.” Truth
we search for, and, once found, we bring it forward before the world,
whencesoever it comes. A large majority of our readers is fully satisfied
with this our policy, and that is plainly sufficient for our purposes.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is evident that when toleration is not the outcome of indifference
it must arise from wide-spreading charity and large-minded sympathy.
Intolerance is preeminently the consequence of ignorance and jealousy.
He who fondly believes that he has got the great ocean in his family
water-jug is naturally intolerant of his neighbour, who also is pleased to
imagine that he has poured the broad expanses of the sea of truth into
his own particular pitcher. But anyone who, like the Theosophists knows
how infinite is that ocean of eternal wisdom, to be fathomed by no one
man, class, or party, and realizes how little the largest vessel made by man
contains in comparison to what lies dormant and still unperceived in
its dark, bottomless depths, cannot help but be tolerant. For he sees
that others have filled their little water-jugs at the same great
reservoir in which he has dipped his own, and if the water in the
various pitchers seems different to the eye, it can only be because it
is discoloured by impurities that were in the vessel before the pure
crystalline element—a portion of the one eternal and immutable truth—entered
into it.</p>

<p class='c028'>There is, and can be, but one absolute truth in Kosmos. And little as
we, with our present limitations, can understand it in its essence, we still
know that if it is absolute it must also be omnipresent and universal;
and that in such case, it must be underlying every world-religion—the
product of the thought and knowledge of numberless generations of
thinking men. Therefore, that a portion of truth, great or small, is
found in every religious and philosophical system, and that if we would
find it, we have to search for it at the origin and source of every such
system, at its roots and first growth, not in its later overgrowth of
sects and dogmatism. Our object is not to destroy any religion but
rather to help to filter each, thus ridding them of their respective
impurities. In this we are opposed by all those who maintain, against
evidence, that their particular pitcher alone contains the whole ocean.
How is our great work to be done if we are to be impeded and harassed
on every side by partisans and zealots? It would be already half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>accomplished were the intelligent men, at least, of every sect and system,
to feel and to confess that the little wee bit of truth they themselves
own must necessarily be mingled with error, and that their neighbours'
mistakes are, like their own, mixed with truth.</p>

<p class='c028'>Free discussion, temperate, candid, undefiled by personalities and
animosity, is, we think, the most efficacious means of getting rid of
error and bringing out the underlying truth; and this applies to publications
as well as to persons. It is open to a magazine to be tolerant or
intolerant; it is open to it to err in almost every way in which an
individual can err; and since every publication of the kind has a
responsibility such as falls to the lot of few individuals, it behoves it
to be ever on its guard, so that it may advance without fear and without
reproach. All this is true in a special degree in the case of a theosophical
publication, and <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> feels that it would be unworthy of that
designation were it not true to the profession of the broadest tolerance
and catholicity, even while pointing out to its brothers and neighbours
the errors which they indulge in and follow. While thus keeping strictly,
in its editorials, and in articles by its individual editors, to the spirit and
teachings of pure theosophy, it nevertheless frequently gives room
to articles and letters which diverge widely from the esoteric
teachings accepted by the editors, as also by the majority of theosophists.
Readers, therefore, who are accustomed to find in magazines
and party publications only such opinions and arguments as the editor
believes to be unmistakably orthodox—from his peculiar standpoint—must
not condemn any article in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> with which they are not
entirely in accord, or in which expressions are used that may be offensive
from a sectarian or a <em>prudish</em> point of view, on the ground that such are
unfitted for a theosophical magazine. They should remember that
precisely because <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> is a theosophical magazine, it opens its
columns to writers whose views of life and things may not only slightly
differ from its own, but even be diametrically opposed to the opinion of
the editors. The object of the latter is to elicit truth, not to advance
the interest of any particular <em>ism</em>, or to pander to any hobbies, likes or
dislikes, of any class of readers. It is only snobs and prigs who, disregarding
the truth or error of the idea, cavil and strain merely over
the expressions and words it is couched in. Theosophy, if meaning
anything, means truth; and truth has to deal indiscriminately and in
the same spirit of impartiality with vessels of honour and of dishonour
alike. No theosophical publication would ever dream of adopting
the coarse—or shall we say terribly sincere—language of a Hosea or a
Jeremiah; yet so long as those holy prophets are found in the Christian
Bible, and the Bible is in every respectable, pious family, whether
aristocratic or plebeian; and so long as the Bible is read with bowed
head and in all reverence by young, innocent maidens and school-boys,
why should our Christian critics fall foul of any phrase which may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>have to be used—if truth be spoken at all—in an occasional article
upon a scientific subject? It is to be feared that the same sentences
now found objectionable, because referring to Biblical subjects, would
be loudly praised and applauded had they been directed against any
gentile system of faith (<em>Vide certain missionary organs</em>). A little charity,
gentle readers—charity, and above all—<em>fairness</em> and <span class='fss'>JUSTICE</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Justice demands that when the reader comes across an article in this
magazine which does not immediately approve itself to his mind by
chiming in with his own peculiar ideas, he should regard it as a problem
to solve rather than as a mere subject of criticism. Let him endeavour
to learn the lesson which only opinions differing from his own can teach
him. <em>Let him be tolerant, if not actually charitable</em>, and postpone
his judgment till he extracts from the article the truth it must contain,
adding this new acquisition to his store. One ever learns more from
one’s enemies than from one’s friends; and it is only when the reader
has credited this hidden truth to <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, that he can fairly presume
to put what he believes to be the errors of the article, he does not like,
to the debit account.</p>

in a chapel. This is flattering for both parties concerned. The editors have
no objection, but Mr. Massey is obdurate enough to refuse his permission and
sufficiently unfeeling to have called the pretty “adaptation” a <span class='fss'>PARODY</span>. The
“Lady of Light” was to have run in this wise:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>“It is divine philosophy alone, the spiritual and psychic blending of
man with nature, which, by revealing the fundamental truths
that lie hidden under the objects of sense and perception, can
promote a spirit of unity and harmony in spite of the great diversities
of conflicting creeds. Theosophy, therefore, expects and demands from
the Fellows of the Society a great mutual toleration and charity for
each other’s shortcomings, ungrudging mutual help in the search for
truths in every department of nature—moral and physical. And this
ethical standard must be unflinchingly applied to daily life.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Theosophy should not represent merely a collection of moral verities,
a bundle of metaphysical ethics, epitomized in theoretical dissertations.
Theosophy <em>must be made practical</em>; and it has, therefore, to be disencumbered
of useless digressions, in the sense of desultory orations
and fine talk. Let every Theosophist only do his duty, that which he
can and ought to do, and very soon the sum of human misery, within
and around the areas of every Branch of your Society, will be found
visibly diminished. Forget <span class='sc'>Self</span> in working for others—and the task
will become an easy and a light one for you....</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do not set your pride in the appreciation and acknowledgment of
that work by others. Why should any member of the Theosophical
Society, striving to become a Theosophist, put any value upon his
neighbours’ good or bad opinion of himself and his work, so long as he
himself knows it to be useful and beneficent to other people? Human
praise and enthusiasm are short-lived at best; the laugh of the scoffer
and the condemnation of the indifferent looker-on are sure to follow, and
generally to out-weigh the admiring praise of the friendly. Do not
despise the opinion of the world, nor provoke it uselessly to unjust
criticism. Remain rather as indifferent to the abuse as to the praise of
those who can never know you as you really are, and who ought, therefore,
to find you unmoved by either, and ever placing the approval or condemnation
of your own <em>Inner Self</em> higher than that of the multitudes.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Those of you who would know yourselves in the spirit of truth, learn
to live alone even amidst the great crowds which may sometimes surround
you. Seek communion and intercourse only with the God within your
own soul; heed only the praise or blame of that deity which can never
be separated from your <em>true</em> self, <em>as it is verily that God itself</em>: called
the <span class='sc'>Higher Consciousness</span>. Put without delay your good intentions
into practice, never leaving a single one to remain only an intention—expecting,
meanwhile, neither reward nor even acknowledgment for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the good you may have done. Reward and acknowledgment are in yourself
and inseparable from you, as it is your Inner Self alone which can
appreciate them at their true degree and value. For each one of you
contains within the precincts of his inner tabernacle the Supreme Court—prosecutor,
defence, jury and judge—whose sentence is the only one
without appeal; since none can know you better than you do yourself,
when once you have learned to judge that Self by the never wavering light
of the inner divinity—your higher <span class='sc'>Consciousness</span>. Let, therefore, the
masses, which can never know your true selves, condemn your outer
selves according to their own false lights....</p>

<p class='c028'>“The majority of the public Areopagus is generally composed of self-appointed
judges, who have never made a permanent deity of any idol
save their own personalities—their lower selves; for those who try
in their walk in life, to follow their <em>inner light</em> will never be found
judging, far less condemning, those weaker than themselves. What does
it matter then, whether the former condemn or praise, whether they
humble you or exalt you on a pinnacle? They will never comprehend
you one way or the other. They may make an idol of you, so long as
they imagine you a faithful mirror of themselves on the pedestal or
altar which they have reared for you, and while you amuse or benefit
them. You cannot expect to be anything for them but a temporary
<em>fetish</em>, succeeding another fetish just overthrown, and followed in your
turn by another idol. Let, therefore, those who have created that idol
destroy it whenever they like, casting it down with as little cause as they
had for setting it up. Your Western Society can no more live without
its Khalif of an hour than it can worship one for any longer period; and
whenever it breaks an idol and then besmears it with mud, it is not the
model, but the disfigured image created by its own foul fancy and which
it has endowed with its own vices, that Society dethrones and breaks.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Theosophy can only find objective expression in an all-embracing
code of life, thoroughly impregnated with the spirit of mutual tolerance,
charity, and brotherly love. Its Society, as a body, has a task before it
which, unless performed with the utmost discretion, will cause the world
of the indifferent and the selfish to rise up in arms against it. Theosophy
has to fight intolerance, prejudice, ignorance, and selfishness,
hidden under the mantle of hypocrisy. It has to throw all the light it
can from the torch of Truth, with which its servants are entrusted. It
must do this without fear or hesitation, dreading neither reproof nor
condemnation. Theosophy, through its mouthpiece, the Society, has to
tell the <span class='sc'>Truth</span> to the very face of <span class='sc'>Lie</span>; to beard the tiger in its den,
without thought or fear of evil consequences, and to set at defiance
calumny and threats. <em>As an Association</em>, it has not only the right, but
the duty to uncloak vice and do its best to redress wrongs, whether
through the voice of its chosen lecturers or the printed word of its
journals and publications—making its accusations, however, as impersonal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>as possible. But its Fellows, or Members, have <em>individually</em> no such
right. Its followers have, first of all, to set the example of a firmly outlined
and as firmly applied morality, before they obtain the right to
point out, even in a spirit of kindness, the absence of a like ethic unity
and singleness of purpose in other associations or individuals. No
Theosophist should blame a brother, whether within or outside of the
association; neither may he throw a slur upon another’s actions or
denounce him, lest he himself lose the right to be considered a Theosophist.
For, as such, he has to turn away his gaze from the imperfections
of his neighbour, and centre rather his attention upon his own
shortcomings, in order to correct them and become wiser. Let him not
show the disparity between claim and action in another, but, whether
in the case of a brother, a neighbour, or simply a fellow man, let him
rather ever help one weaker than himself on the arduous walk of life.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The problem of true Theosophy and its great mission are, first, the
working out of clear unequivocal conceptions of ethic ideas and duties,
such as shall best and most fully satisfy the right and altruistic feelings
in men; and second, the modelling of these conceptions for their adaptation
into such forms of daily life, as shall offer a field where they may
be applied with most equitableness.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Such is the common work placed before all who are willing to act
on these principles. It is a laborious task, and will require strenuous
and persevering exertion; but it must lead you insensibly to progress,
and leave you no room for any selfish aspirations outside the limits
traced.... Do not indulge personally in unbrotherly comparison
between the task accomplished by yourself and the work left undone by
your neighbours or brothers. In the fields of Theosophy <em>none is held
to weed out a larger plot of ground than his strength and capacity will
permit him</em>. Do not be too severe on the merits or demerits of one
who seeks admission among your ranks, as the truth about the actual
state of the inner man can only be known to Karma, and can be dealt
with justly by that all-seeing <span class='sc'>Law</span> alone. Even the simple presence
amidst you of a well-intentioned and sympathising individual may help
you magnetically.... You are the free volunteer workers on the fields
of Truth, and as such must leave no obstruction on the paths leading to
that field.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The cloud lifted to reveal Fleta’s face. She was bending over him;
she was at his side; she was almost leaning her face on his.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My dear, my dear,” she said in a soft whispering voice, “has
the blow been too great? Tell me, Hilary, speak to me? Have you
still your senses?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And you love that man?” was Hilary’s sole answer, fixing his eyes
in a cold strange gaze on her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh! Hilary, you talk of what is unknown to you! I love him, yes,
and with a love so profound it is unimaginable to you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And you tell me this! You tell this to the man who loves you, and
who has already devoted his whole life to you! Do you want a madman
for your service?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“A life!” exclaimed Fleta, with a strange tone that had a ring as of
scorn in it. “What is a life? I count it nothing. Our great aims lie
beyond such considerations.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary raised himself and looked into her face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Then you are mad,” he said, “and if so, a madman in your service
is but fit. Nevertheless, my Princess, do not forget with what forces you
have to contend. I am but a man; you have accepted my love. Only
just now you have made me a murderer at heart—in desire. How soon
shall I be one in reality? That depends on you, Fleta. The next time
I see your gaze fixed on that man’s face as I saw it but now I will kill
him.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta rose to her full height and lifted her face to the sky; as she
stood there a sort of shiver passed through her, a shiver as of pain.
Instantly Hilary’s humour changed. “You are ill,” he exclaimed. She
turned her eyes on him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“When that murderous mood is on you, it will not be Father Ivan
that you kill, but me, whom you profess to love. Do you understand
that?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah!” cried Hilary, uttering a sound as if his heart was bursting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>under the torture, “that is because you love him so! Well, I can only
long and serve. I have no power to protest. Yet I ask you, oh!
Princess, is it fit to use a man’s heart to play at your queenly coquetries
with? A king, your betrothed—a mysterious priest, the man you love—are
not these enough but that you must take a boy, obscure and untaught
in such misfortunes, and trample on his love? It is unlike the
nobility I have seen in you. Good-bye, for this, Princess! I am never
your lover again as I was before. I can never believe in your pure
sweet heart—only this morning it seemed to me as a pearl, as a drop of
limpid water. Good-bye, my idol! Yet I am your servant to obey
always, for I gave you my life to do with as you would. Call me, and I
come, like your dog; but I will not stay by you, for no longer is it anything
but pain to do so.”</p>

<p class='c028'>With these wild, fierce reproaches, which seemed to stir the quiet air
of the woodland, and make it seethe and burn with passion and despair,
he turned and went from her. Fleta stood motionless, and her eyes
drooped heavily; only she murmured, “We were born under the same
star!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Her voice was very low, yet it reached Hilary’s ear. The words seemed
to lash his heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Under the same star!” he repeated, in a voice of agony, standing
suddenly still. “No, Fleta. You are the queen, I the subject. Not
only so, but you know it, and use your power to the full. Did you not
promise yourself utterly to me to be mine?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I promised to give you my love for yours; I promised to give you
all that you can take of me. My love is greater than you can even
imagine, else I would not have listened to one word of your reproaches.
They have humbled me, but I have borne it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah, Fleta! you talk enigmas,” exclaimed Hilary, moving rapidly
back to her side; “you are enough to madden a man; yet I cannot but
love you. Why is this? Every act of yours proves you heartless, faithless,
and yet I love you! Why is this? Oh, that I could read the riddle
of your existence! Who are you?—What is this mysterious place?—Who
is that priest whose rule you acknowledge? I <em>will</em> know!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta turned on him a sudden sweet smile, that seemed to light up his
inner being as the flame of a lamp illumines a dusky room.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” she said, “find out. I cannot tell you, yet I desire you—oh!
indeed, I desire you to know. Compel the secret—force it. Yes, yes,
Hilary!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She spoke eagerly, with a bright ring in her voice that thrilled his soul.
He forgot the Princess, the conspirator, the religieuse—he only remembered
the girl he loved—young, fresh, flower-like, with the fair sweet face
close to his own. With an unutterable cry of love he held out his arms
to her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, my dear, my love, come!” he said, in trembling tones that vibrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>with his passion. But Fleta turned away without a word and walked
through the tall ferns, her robe trailing on the ground. No backward
glance, no turn of the head, not even a movement of those white
statuesque hands which hung at her sides. In one was a long grass
which she had plucked before she came to him. Even that, though it
fluttered in the wind, had a strangely stiff air, as if it had become a
part of that statue which but a moment since was a woman. Hilary
stood gazing after this retreating figure, powerless to move, powerless to
rouse in his mind any thought but one; and that was not a thought.
It was knowledge—consciousness. He knew, he felt, that he dared
not follow Fleta and address her as men address the women they love;
he dared not woo her with the fever on his lips that burned there. And
why? Not because of her royal birth, or her beauty, or her power.
He knew not why—he could not understand himself. It was as though
a spell were cast on him that held him silent and motionless.</p>

<p class='c028'>When at last she was out of sight a sudden reaction took place. The
whole burning force of the strong young man’s nature broke loose and
raged wildly through his whole system; he no longer was capable of
thought, he only felt the blood that rushed to his head and made his
brain reel as though he had drunk strong wine. He suddenly became
aware that he had aged, grown, become a new creature in these last
moments of experience. He had called himself a man five minutes ago;
but now he knew that when he had uttered those words, he was only a
boy. Across a great gulf of feeling he looked back at the love that was
in him when he had so spoken. Now his passion burned like a fire on
the altar of life; every instant the flames grew stronger and mounted
more fiercely to his inflamed brain.</p>

<p class='c028'>The savage had burst forth. The savage untamed man, which
smoulders within, and hides behind the cultivated faces of a gentle age.
One strong touch on the chord of passion, and Hilary Estanol, a
chivalric and courteous product of a refined time, knew himself to be a
man, and knew that man to be a <a id='corr349.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='savage'>savage.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_349.32'><ins class='correction' title='savage'>savage.</ins></a></span> A savage, full of desire, of
personal longing, thinking of nothing but his own needs. And to
Hilary this sudden starting forth of the nature within him seemed like a
splendid unfolding. He remained standing, erect, strong, resolute.
His seething mind hastily went over his whole position and Fleta’s.
Everything suddenly bore a new, vivid, stirring aspect.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This is a nest of conspirators!” he exclaimed to himself. “That
man, Ivan, is a conspirator or worse, else he would not hide here. What
crowned head is it that he threatens? He is a criminal. I will discover
his secret; I will rescue Fleta from him; by the strength of my
love I will win her love from him; I will make her my own. Come, I
must calm myself—I must be sober, for I have to find out the meaning
of this mysterious place.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He walked slowly through the wood, trying to still the throbbing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>his brain, to check the fierce pulsations of his heart and blood. He knew
that now he needed all his instincts, all his natural intelligence, all his
power of defence; for, in his present humour, he walked as an enemy to
all men; by his new tide of feeling he had made every man his enemy.
The young King Otto had a prior right to the Fleta whom he desired to
make his own; King Otto was indeed his enemy. Ivan had her love;
how bitterly did Hilary hate that priest! And Adine, the false Fleta—what
was she but a mere tool of the priest’s, a creature used to baffle and
blind him? She was the one most likely to trip his steps, for she defied
even the knowledge which his love gave him of Fleta’s face!</p>

<p class='c028'>He was full of energy and activity, and his blood desired to be stilled
by action. He had quickly decided that he must immediately do two
things: inspect the whole exterior of the house, so as to get some notion
of what rooms were in it, and what their uses; and explore the outer
circle of the grounds, to see if there was any difficulty about leaving
them. As the latter task involved most exercise, he chose to undertake
it first, and swiftly, with long strides, made his way through the woodlands
in the direction where the boundaries must lie. It did not take
him long to traverse a considerable distance; for he felt stronger than
ever in his life before. He had been a delicate lad, now he knew himself
to be a strong man, as if new blood ran in his veins. The moon was
high in the heavens, it was nearly full, and its light was strong. By it
he soon discovered that the strange place in which he was had a more
cunning and effective defence than any high wall or iron barrier. It was
surrounded by tangled virgin woodland growth, where, as it seemed, no
man’s foot could have ever trodden.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary found it hard to believe that such wild land existed within a
drive of the city. But it was there, and there was no passing through
it, unless he worked his way with a wood-axe, inch by inch, as men do
when they make a clearing. Such a task was hopeless, even if he had
the tools, for it was impossible to tell in what direction to move.</p>

<p class='c028'>He returned at last, after many fruitless efforts; there seemed to be
no vestige of a path. He had discovered the gate by which their entrance
had been made; and discovered also that it was guarded. A figure
moved slowly to and fro in the shadow of the trees; not with the air of
one strolling for pleasure, but with the regular movements of a sentry.
It was an unfamiliar figure, but dressed in the garb of the order.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary went quietly along by the side of the path that led to the
house. It was useless to waste more time on this investigation; quite
clearly he was a prisoner. And it seemed to him equally clear that unless
he could escape, no information would be of any use to him. He must
be able to carry it to the city, where he would be free to take it to
Fleta’s father, or even to other crowned heads in other countries, according
to its nature. As he walked quietly on, revolving his position,
he saw that the task he had set himself was no light one, even for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>strong man possessed by love. These monks belonged to an extraordinarily
powerful order, and were men of great ability.</p>

<p class='c028'>Here he was, in the very heart of one of their secret centres, which
was, presumably, political. Fleta and King Otto were under their
influence. And they were magicians; very certain he felt that they
knew some of Nature’s secrets, and had trained Fleta in her mysterious
powers. And from this hidden and carefully guarded place he was
determined to escape, taking with him its secret—and Fleta! Fleta,
his love, his own, yet whom he had to win by his strength.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<p class='c035'>In the long corridor through which Fleta had led Hilary to Father Ivan’s
room there was another door, which was fastened in a very different
manner. It was held in its place by iron clamps which would puzzle the
beholder, for they fastened on the outside as though they secured the door
of a prison instead of being any protection for the inhabitant of the room
beyond. It was inside this door that Fleta was now lying down to rest
for the night. Had Hilary known this what agony would have torn
him! He would have felt that he must break those bars and release
the prisoner within them, however supernatural the strength might be
which would be needed. He was spared the sharp pain of knowing
this, however, and he was not likely to learn it, for a strange sentinel
patrolled the long corridor with even step—Father Ivan himself. Without
any pause he went steadily to and fro.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was about midnight that Father Ivan went into his room and
glanced at a clock on the chimney-piece; not quite midnight, but very
nearly. Hilary was lying awake in his room, tossing to and fro on a
very luxurious and tempting bed, which gave him, however, no hope of
rest. He had wandered round and round the house a dozen times, only to
find himself bewildered by its strange shape, and the shrubberies which
grew up close to the walls, and disheartened by the solid barricading of
those windows which it was easy to approach. And yet at last he found a
window wide open, and a room brightly lit; a lamp stood on the table
and showed the pleasant room, well-furnished, and with a bed in it, dressed
in fine linen and soft laces such as perhaps only members of an ascetic
order know how to offer to their guests. Hilary stood a moment on the
threshold, and then suddenly recognised it as his own <a id='corr351.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='room,'>room.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_351.36'><ins class='correction' title='room,'>room.</ins></a></span> It gave
him an odd feeling, this, as if he had been watched and arranged for;
treated like a prisoner. Well, it was useless to evade that dark fact—a
prisoner he was. Recognising defeat for the moment, Hilary determined
to accept it as gracefully as might be. He entered, closed his window
and the strong shutters which folded over it, and then quickly laid
himself down with intent to sleep. But sleep would not come, and he
found all his thoughts and all his interest centred on Father Ivan. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>tried to prevent this but could not; he chased Fleta’s image in vain—he
could scarcely remember her beautiful face! What was its shape
and colour? He tortured himself in trying to recall the face he loved
so dearly. But always Father Ivan’s figure was before his eyes; and
suddenly it struck him that this vision was almost real, for he saw Ivan
raise his hand in a commanding gesture which seemed to be directed
towards himself. A moment later and he fell fast asleep, like a tired
child. At this moment Ivan was standing in his own room, looking for
an instant at the clock. He stood, perhaps, a little longer than was
needed in order to see the time; and a frown came on his fine clear
forehead which drew the arched eyebrows together. Then he turned
quickly, left his room, and closed its door behind him. He went to the
door which was so strongly barred, and noiselessly loosened its fastenings,
which swung heavily yet quite softly away from it. He opened the
door and went in.</p>

<p class='c028'>In a sort of curtained recess was a low divan, which quite filled it,
rising hardly a foot from the ground. This was covered with great rugs
made of bear and wolf skin. Fleta lay stretched upon them, wrapped
in a long cloak of some thick white material, which was bordered all
round with white fur, and, indeed, lined with it, too. And yet when
Ivan stooped and touched her hand it was cold as ice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” he said; and turning, went slowly away from her. Fleta
rose and followed him. Her eyes were half-closed, and had something of
the appearance of a sleep-walker’s, and yet not altogether, for though
they appeared dim and unseeing yet there was purpose, and consciousness,
and resolution in them. No one who had not seen Fleta before in
this state could have recognised those eyes, so set and strange were
they. Ivan approached a large curtained archway, and drawing the
curtain aside he motioned to Fleta to pass through. As she did so he
touched one of her hands, as it hung at her side. Immediately she
raised it, and throwing the cloak aside showed that she held a white silk
mask. Her dress beneath the cloak was of white silk. Slowly she
raised the mask to her face and was about to put it on when a change
of state came so suddenly upon her that it was like a tropical tornado.
She opened her starry eyes wide and vivid light flashed from them; she
flung the mask away upon the floor and clasped her hands violently
together, while her whole frame shook with emotion.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Why must I mask myself?” she exclaimed. “You have not told
me why.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have,” said Ivan, very quietly. “No woman has ever entered there
till now.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“What then?” cried Fleta, fiercely. “There is no shame in being a
woman! Have I not assailed that door in vain in a different character?
Now, a woman, I demand entrance. Master, I will not disguise
myself.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>“Be it so,” said Ivan, “yet take the mask with you lest your mood
should change again. You were willing, you remember, but a while
since.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta stood motionless regarding the mask as it lay on the floor.
Then she lifted her head suddenly and looked Ivan straight in the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will cast my sex from me, and mask my womanhood without any
such help as that.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Immediately that she had spoken Ivan walked on. They were in a
long corridor, lit, and with the walls faintly coloured in pale pink on
which shone some silver stars. Yet, bright though it was, this corridor
seemed strangely solemn. Why was it so? Fleta looked from side to
side, and could not discover. There was something new to her which
she did not understand. Though she had been instructed in so many of
the mysteries, and so much of the knowledge of the order, she had never
entered this corridor, nor indeed had she before known of its existence.
They slowly neared the end of it where was a high door made of oak,
and seemingly very solidly fastened; but Father Ivan opened it easily
enough.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My God!” cried Fleta instantly, in a low voice of deep amazement.
“Where am I? What country am I in? Father, was that corridor
a magic place? This is no longer my own country! How far
have you carried me in this short time?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“A long way my daughter; come, do not delay.”</p>

<p class='c028'>A vast plain, prairie-like, stretched before them, encircled on the right
by the narrowing end of a huge arm of mountains which disappeared
upon the far horizon. Upon the plain was one spot, was one place,
where a livid flame-like light burned, and could be seen, though the
whole scene was bathed in strong moonlight. Ivan commenced to
rapidly take his way down a steep path which lay before them. And
then Fleta became aware that they were themselves upon a height and
had to descend into the plain. She did not look back; all her thoughts
were centred on that vivid light which she now saw came from the
windows of a great building. Then she suddenly saw that a number of
persons were in the plain; although it was so large yet there were
enough people to look like a crowd, which was gathering together from
different directions. All were approaching the building.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Father,” she said to Ivan, who was leading the way rapidly. “Will
they go in?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Into the Temple? Those on the plain? Indeed no. They are
outside worshippers; that crowd is in the world and of it, and yet has
courage to come here often when there is no light, and the icy winds
blow keen across the plain.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And they never enter. Why, my master, they can have no
strength.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Ivan glanced back for an instant, a curious look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is not always strength that is needed,” he said in a low voice.
Fleta did not seem to hear him; her eyes were fixed on the temple
windows. Suddenly she stopped and cried out:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Is this a dream?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are not asleep,” said Ivan with a smile.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Asleep! no,” she answered, and went on her way with increased
rapidity.</p>

<p class='c028'>Very soon they stood on the plain and advanced with great speed
towards the temple. Fleta was naturally hardy; but now it seemed to
her that the very idea of fatigue was absurd. She could scale mountains
in order to reach that light. And yet what was it in it that drew
her so? None but herself could have told. But Fleta’s heart beat
passionately with longing at the sight of it. Ivan turned on her a
glance of compassion.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Keep quiet,” he said.</p>

<p class='c028'>He was answered with a look and tone of fervour.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes: if it is in human power,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c028'>The great crowds were slowly gathering towards the temple and
formed themselves into masses of silent and scarcely moving figures.
Fleta was now among them and though so absorbed by the idea of the
goal before her, she was attracted by the strange appearance of these
people. They were of all ages and nationalities, but more than two-thirds
of them were men; they one and all had the appearance of sleep-walkers,
seeming perfectly unconscious of the scene in which they
moved and of their object in reaching it. Their whole nature was turned
inwards; so it appeared to Fleta. Why then had they come to this
strange place, so difficult of access, if when come they could neither see
nor hear? Fleta considered these things rapidly in her mind and would
again have asked an explanation of Father Ivan but that while her
steps slackened a little, his had hastened. He had already reached the
door of the temple—when Fleta reached it he was not there. Of course
he had entered, and Fleta, without fear or hesitation, put her hand on
the great bar which held the door and lifted it. It was not difficult to
lift; it seemed to yield to her touch, and swung back smoothly. With
a slight push the great door opened a little before her—not wide; only
as far as she had pushed it. Ah! there was the light! There, in her
eyes! It was like life and joy to Fleta. She turned her eyes up to gaze
on it, and stood an instant with her hands clasped, in ecstacy.</p>

<p class='c028'>Someone brushed lightly by, and, passing her, went straight in.
That reminded her that she, too, desired to go straight in. She nerved
herself for the supreme effort. For she was learned enough to know
that only the initiate in her faith could enter that door; and she had
not, in any outward form, passed the initiation. But she believed she
had passed it in her soul; she had tested her emotions on every side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>and found the world was nothing to her; she had flung her mask away
believing her woman’s shape and face to be the merest outward appearance,
which would be unseen at the great moment. And now it hardly
seemed as if she were a woman—she stood transfigured by the nobility
of her aspirations—and some who stood on the step outside remained
there awestruck by her majestic beauty. By a supreme effort she
resolved to face all—and to conquer all. She boldly entered the door
and went up the white marble steps within it. A great hall was before
her, flooded with the clear, soft light she loved; an innumerable number
of objects presented themselves to her amazed eyes, but she did not
pause to look at them—she guessed that the walls were jewelled from
their sparkling—she guessed that the floor was covered with flowers,
which lay on a polished silver surface, from the gleaming and the
colour—and who were these, the figures in silver dresses with a jewel
like an eye that saw, clasped at the neck? A number came towards her.
She would not allow herself to feel too exultant—she tried to steady
herself—and yet joy came wildly into her heart, for she felt that she
was already one of this august company. But their faces, as they gathered
nearer, were all strange and unfamiliar. She looked from one to
another.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where is Ivan?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c028'>Suddenly all was changed. The white figures grew in numbers till
there seemed thousands—with outstretched hands they pushed Fleta
down the steps—down, down, down, resist how she might. She did
more! She fought, she battled, she cried aloud, first for justice, then for
pity. But there was no relenting, no softening in these superhuman
faces. Fleta fled at last from their overpowering numbers and inexorable
cruelty, and then there came a great cry of voices, all uttering the same
words;</p>

<p class='c028'>“You love him! Go!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta fell, stunned and broken, at the foot of the outer step, and the
great door closed behind her. But she was not unconscious for more
than a few minutes. She opened her eyes and looked at the starry sky.
Then she felt suddenly that she could not endure even that light and
that the stars were reading her soul. She rose and hurried away,
blindly following in any path that her feet found. It did not take her
to any familiar place. She found herself in a dark wood. The moss
was soft and fragrant and violets scented it. She lay down upon it,
drawing her white cloak round her and hiding her eyes from the light.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<p class='c035'>It seemed to her that for long ages she was alone. Her mind achieved
great strides of thought which at another time would have appeared
impossible to her. She saw before her clearly her own folly, her own
mistake. Yesterday she would not have credited it—yesterday it would
have been unmeaning to her. But now she understood it, and understood
too how heavy and terrible was her punishment; for it was already upon
her. She lay helpless, her eyes shut, her whole body nerveless. Her
punishment was here. She had lost all hope, all faith.</p>

<p class='c028'>A gentle touch on her hand roused her consciousness, but she was too
indifferent to open her eyes. It mattered little to her what or who was
near her. The battle of her soul was now the only real thing in life to
her.</p>

<p class='c028'>A voice that seemed strangely familiar fell on her ears; yet last time
she had heard it it was loud, fierce, arrogant; now it was tender and soft,
and full of an overwhelming wonder and pity.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You, Princess Fleta, here? My God! what can have happened?
Surely she is not dead? No! What is it, then?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta slowly opened her eyes. It was Hilary who knelt beside her;
she was lying on the dewy grass, and Hilary knelt there, the morning
sun shining on his head and lighting up his beautiful boy’s face. And
Fleta as she lay and looked dully at him felt herself to be immeasurably
older than he was; to be possessed of knowledge and experience which
seemed immense by his ignorance. And yet she lay here, nerveless,
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is it?” again asked Hilary, growing momently more
distressed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you want to know?” she said gently, and yet with an accent of
pity that was almost contempt in her tone. “You would not understand.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, tell me!” said Hilary. “I love you—let me serve you!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She hardly seemed to hear his words, but his voice of entreaty made
her go on speaking in answer:</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have tried,” she said, “and failed.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Tried what?” exclaimed Hilary, “and how failed? Oh, my Princess,
I believe these devils of priests have given you some fever—you do not
know what you are saying!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I know very well,” replied Fleta; “I am in no fever. I am all but
dead—that is no strange thing, for I am stricken.” Hilary looked at her
as she lay, and saw that her words were true. How strange a figure
she looked, lying there so immovably, as if crushed or dead, upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>dewy grass; wrapped in her white robes. And her face was white with
a terrible whiteness; the great eyes looked out from the white face with
a sad, smileless gaze; and would those pale drawn lips never smile
again? Was the radiant, brilliant Fleta changed for ever into this
paralysed white creature? Hilary knew that even if it was so he loved
her more passionately and devotedly than before. His soul yearned
towards her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Tell me, explain to me, what has done this?” he cried out, growing
almost incoherent in his passionate distress. “I demand to know by my
love for you. What have you tried to do in this awful past night?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta opened her eyes, the lids of which had drooped heavily, and
looked straight into his as she answered:</p>

<p class='c028'>“I have tried for the Mark of the White Brotherhood. I have tried to
pass the first initiation of the Great Order. I did not dream I could
fail, for I have passed through many initiations which men regard with
fear. But I have failed.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I cannot believe,” said Hilary, “that you could fail in anything. You
are—dreaming—you are feverish. Let me lift you, let me carry you into
the house.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, I have failed,” answered Fleta dully; “failed, because I had not
measured the strength of my humanity. It is in me—in me still! I am
the same as any other woman in this land. I, who thought myself
supreme—I, who thought myself capable of great deeds! Ah, Hilary,
the first simple lesson is yet unlearned. I have failed because I loved—because
I love like any other fond and foolish woman! And yet no
spark of any part of love but devotion is in my soul. That is too
gross. Is it possible to purge even that away? Yes, those of the
White Brotherhood have done it. I will do it even if it take me a
thousand years, a dozen lifetimes!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She had raised herself from the ground as she spoke, for a new fierce
passion had taken the place of the dull despair in her manner; she had
raised herself to her feet, and then unable to stand had fallen on to her
knees. Hilary listened yet hardly heard; only some of her words
hurried into his mind. He bent down till his face touched her white
cloak where it lay on the grass, and kissed it a dozen times.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have failed because of love? Oh, my Princess, then it is not
failure! Men live for love, men die for love! It is the golden power of
life. Oh, my Princess, let me take you from this terrible place—come back
with me to the world where men and women know love to be the one great
joy for which all else is well lost. Fleta, while I doubted that you loved
me I was as wax; but now that I know you do, and with a love so great
that it has power to check the career of your soul, now I am strong, I
am able to do all that a strong man can do. Come, let me raise you
and take you away from here to a place of peace and delight!”</p>

<p class='c028'>He had risen to his feet and stood before her, looking magnificent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>the morning sunshine. He was slight of build, yet that slightness was
really indicative of strength; when Hilary Estanol had been effeminate
it was because he had not cared to be anything else. He stood grandly
now, his hands stretched towards her; a man, lofty, transformed by the
power of love. Fleta looking at him saw in his brilliant eyes the gleam
of the conquering savage. She rose suddenly and confronted him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are mistaken,” she said abruptly. “It is not you that I love.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Then, as suddenly as Fleta had moved and spoken, the man before
her vanished, with his nobility, and left the savage only, unvarnished,
unhumanised.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My God,” gasped Hilary, almost breathless from the sudden blow,
“then it is that accursed priest?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” answered Fleta, her eyes on his, her voice dull, her whole form
like that of a statue, so emotionless did she seem, “it is that accursed
priest.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She moved away from him and looked about her. The spot was
familiar. She was in the woodland about the monastery. She
could find her way home now without difficulty. And yet how
weak she was, and how hard it was to take each footstep! After
moving a few paces she stood still and tried to rouse herself, tried to use
her powerful will.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where are my servants?” she said in a low voice. “Where are
those who do my bidding?”</p>

<p class='c028'>She closed her eyes, and standing there in the sunlight, used all her
power to call the forces into action which she had learned to control.
For she was a sufficiently learned magician to be the mistress of some
of the secrets of Nature. But now it seemed she was helpless—her old
powers were gone. A low, bitter cry of anguish escaped from her lips
as she realised this awful fact. Hilary, terrified by the strange sound
of her voice, hastily approached her and looked into her face. Those
dark eyes, once so full of power, were now full of an agony such as one
sees in the eyes of a hunted and dying creature. Yet Fleta did not
faint or fail, or cling to the strong man who stood by her side. After
a moment she spoke, with a faint yet steady voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you know the way to the gate?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” replied Hilary; who indeed had but recently explored the
whole demesne.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Take my hand,” she said, “and lead me there.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She used her natural power of royal command now; feeble though
she was, she was the princess. Hilary did not dream of disobeying her.
He took the cold and lifeless hand she extended to him, and led her
as quickly as was possible over the grass, through the trees and
flowering shrubs, to the gateway. As they neared it she spoke:</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are to go back to the city,” she said. “Do not ask why—you
must go; yet I will tell you this—it is for your own safety. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>lost my power—I can no longer protect you, and there are both angels
and devils in this place. I have lost all! all! And I have no right to
risk your sanity as well as my own. You must go.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And leave you here?” said Hilary, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am safe,” she answered proudly. “No power in heaven or earth
can hurt me now, for I have cast my all on one stake. Know this,
Hilary, before we part; I shall never yield or surrender. I shall cast
out that love that kills me from my heart—I shall enter the White
Brotherhood. And, Hilary, you too will enter it. But, oh! not yet!
Bitter lessons have you yet to learn! Good-bye, my brother.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The sentinel who guarded the gate now approached them in his walk;
Fleta moved quickly towards him. After a few words had passed
between them he blew a shrill, fine whistle. Then he approached
Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Come,” he said, “I will show you the way for some distance and
will then obtain you a horse and a guide to the city.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary did not hesitate in obeying Fleta’s commands; he knew he
must go. But he turned to look once more into her mysterious face.
She was no longer there. He bowed his head, and silently followed the
monk through the gate into the outer freedom of the forest.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta meantime crept back to the house through the shelter of the
trees. Her figure looked like that of an aged woman, for she was
bowed almost double and her limbs trembled as she moved. She did
not go to the centre door of the house, but approached a window which
opened to the ground and now stood wide. It was the window of
Fleta’s own room; she hurried towards it with feeble, uncertain steps.
“Rest! Rest! I must rest!” she kept murmuring to herself. But on
the very threshold she stumbled and fell. Someone came immediately
to her and tried to raise her. It was Father Ivan. Fleta disengaged
herself, tremblingly yet resolutely. She rose with difficulty to her feet
and gazed very earnestly into his face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And you knew why I should fail?” she said.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” he answered, “I knew. You are not strong enough to stand
alone amid the spirit of humanity. I knew you clung to me. Well
have you suffered from it. I know that very soon you will stand alone.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Of what use would that mask have been?” demanded Fleta, pursuing
her own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c028'>“None. If you had obeyed me and worn it you would have been of
so craven a spirit you could never have reached the temple, never have
seen the White Brotherhood. You have done these things, which are
more than any other woman has accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will do yet more,” said Fleta. “I will be one of them.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Be it so,” answered Ivan. “To do so you must suffer as no woman
has yet had strength to suffer. The humanity in you must be crushed
out as we crush a viper beneath our feet.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“It shall be. I may die, but I will not pause. Good-bye, my master.
As I am a queen in the world of men and women, so you are king in
the world of soul, and to you I have done homage; that homage they
call love. It is so, perhaps. I am blind yet, and know not. But no
more may you be my king. I am alone, and all knowledge I gain I
must now gain myself.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Ivan bowed his head as if in obedience to an unanswerable decree,
and in a moment had walked away among the trees. Fleta watched
him stonily till he was out of sight, then dragged herself within the
window to fall helplessly upon the ground, shaken by sobs and strong
shudders of despair.</p>

<hr class='c024' />
<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<p class='c035'>It was late in the day before Fleta again came out of her room. She
seemed to have recovered her natural manner and appearance; and
yet there was a change in her which anyone who knew her well must
see. She had not been into the general rooms, or greeted the other
guests; nor did she do so now. Her face was full of resolution, but
she was calm, at all events externally. Without going near the guest
rooms or the great entrance hall, she made her way round the house to
where a very small door stood almost hidden in an angle of the wall.
It was such a door as might lead to the cellars of a house, and when
Hilary had explored the night before he had scarcely noticed it. But
it was exceedingly solid and well <a id='corr360.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fastened'>fastened.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_360.23'><ins class='correction' title='fastened'>fastened.</ins></a></span> Fleta gave a peculiar
knock upon it with a fan which she carried in her hand. It was immediately
opened, and Father Amyot appeared.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you want me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes; I want you to go on an errand for me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where am I to go?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I do not know; probably you will know. I must speak to one of
the White Brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Amyot’s face clouded and he looked doubtfully at her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is there you can ask that Ivan cannot answer?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Does it matter to you?” said Fleta imperiously. “You are my
messenger, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You cannot command me as before,” said Father Amyot.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What! do you know that I have failed? Does all the world
know it?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The world?” echoed Amyot, contemptuously. “No; but all the
Brotherhood does, and all its servants do. No one has told me, but I
know it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Of course,” said Fleta to herself. “I am foolish.” She turned away
and walked up and down on the grass, apparently buried in deep
thought. Presently she raised her head suddenly, and quickly moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>towards Amyot, who still stood motionless in the dim shadow of the
little doorway. She fixed her eyes on him; they were blazing with an
intense fire. Her whole attitude was one of command.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Go,” she said.</p>

<p class='c028'>Father Amyot stood but for a moment; and then he came out slowly
from the doorway, shutting it behind him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have picked up a lost treasure,” he said. “You have found
your will again. I obey. Have you told me all your command?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes. I must speak to one of the White Brothers. What more can
I say? I do not know one from another. Only be quick!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Instantly Amyot strode away over the grass and disappeared. Fleta
moved slowly away, thinking so deeply that she did not know any one
was near her till a hand was put gently on her arm. She looked up, and
saw before her the young king, Otto.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Have you been ill,” he asked, looking closely into her face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she answered. “I have only been living fast—a century of
experience in a single night! Shall I talk to you about it, my
friend?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I think not,” answered Otto, who now was walking quietly by her
side. <a id='corr361.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='I'>“I</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_361.20'><ins class='correction' title='I'>“I</ins></a></span> may not readily understand you. I am anxious above all to
advance slowly and grasp each truth as it comes to me. I have been
talking a long time to-day to Father Ivan; and I feel that I cannot yet
understand the doctrines of the order except as interpreted through
religion.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Through religion?” said Fleta. “But that is a mere externality.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“True, and intellectually I see that. But I am not strong enough to
stand without any external form to cling to. The precepts of religion,
the duty of each towards humanity, the principle of sacrifice one for
another, these things I can understand. Beyond that I cannot yet go.
Are you disappointed with me?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, indeed,” answered Fleta. “Why should I be.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Otto gave a slight sigh as of relief. “I feared you might be,” he
answered; “but I preferred to be honest. I am ready, Fleta, to be a
member of the order, a devout member of the external Brotherhood.
How far does that place me from you who claim a place among
the wise ones of the inner Brotherhood.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta looked at him very seriously and gravely.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I claim it,” she said; “but is it mine? Yet I will win it, Otto;
even at the uttermost price, I will make it mine.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And at what cost?” said Otto. “What is that uttermost
price?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I think,” she said slowly, “I already feel what it is. I must
learn to live in the plain as contentedly as on the mountain tops. I
have hungered to leave my place in the world, to go to those haunts
where only a few great ones of the earth dwell, and from them learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>the secret of how to finally escape from the life of earth altogether.
That has been my dream, Otto, put into simple words; the old dream
of the Rosicrucian and those hungerers after the occult who have always
haunted the world like ghosts, unsatisfied, homeless. Because I am a
strong-willed creature, because I have learned how to use my will, because
I have been taught a few tricks of magic I fancied myself fitted
to be one of the White Brotherhood. Well, it is not so. I have failed.
I shall be your queen, Otto.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The young king turned on her a sudden look full of mingled
emotions. “Is that to be, Fleta? Then may I be worthy of your companionship.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta had spoken bitterly, though not ungently. Otto’s reply had
been in a strange tone, that had exultation, reverence, gladness, in it; but
not any of the passion which is called love. A coquette would have
been provoked by a manner so entirely that of friendship.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Otto,” said Fleta, after a moment’s pause, during which they had
walked on side by side. “I am going to test your generosity. Will
you leave me now?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“My generosity?” exclaimed Otto. “How is it possible for you to
address me in that way?” Without any further word of explanation
he turned on his heel and walked quickly away. Fleta understood his
meaning very well; she smiled softly as she looked for a moment after
him. Then, as he vanished, her whole face changed, her whole expression
of attitude, too. For a little while she stood quite still, seemingly
wrapt in thought. Then steadily and swiftly she began to move across
the grass and afterwards to thread her way through the trees. Having
once commenced to move, she seemed to have no hesitation as to the
direction in which she was going. And, indeed, if you had been able to
ask her how she knew what path to take, she would have answered that
it was very easy to know. For she was guided by a direct call from Amyot,
as plainly heard as any human voice, though audible only to her inner
hearing. To Fleta, the consciousness of the double life—the spiritual
and the natural—was a matter of constant experience, and, therefore,
there was no need for the darkness of midnight to enable her to hear a
voice from what ordinary men and women call the unseen world. To
Fleta it was no more unseen than unheard. She saw at once, conquering
time and space, the spot where she would find Father Amyot at the
end of her rapid walk; and more, the state she would find him in. The
sun streamed in its full power and splendour straight on the strange
figure of the monk, lying rigidly upon the grass. Fleta stood beside
him and looked down on his face, upturned to the sky. For a little
while she did nothing, but stood there with a frown upon her forehead
and her dark eyes full of fierce and changing feeling. Amyot was in one
of his profound trances, when, though not dead, yet he was as one dead.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Already my difficulties crowd around me,” exclaimed Fleta aloud.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>“What folly shall I unknowingly commit next? My poor servant—dare
I even try to restore you—or will Nature be a safer friend?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Full of doubt and hesitation, she turned slowly away and began to
pace up and down the grass beside the figure of the priest. Presently
she became aware that she was not alone—some one was near her.
She started and turned quickly. Ivan stood but a pace from her, and his
eyes were fixed very earnestly upon her.</p>

<p class='c028'>He was not dressed as a priest, but wore a simple hunting dress, such
as an ordinary sportsman or the king incognito might wear. Simple it was,
and made of coarse materials; but its easy make showed a magnificent
figure which the monkish robes had disguised. His face had on it a
deep and almost pathetic seriousness; and yet it was so handsome, so
nobly cut, and made so brilliant by the deep blue eyes, which were
bluer than their wont now, even in the full blaze of the sun—that in fact
as a man merely, here stood one who might make any woman’s heart,
queen or no queen, beat fiercely with admiration. Fleta had never seen
him like this before; to her he had always been the master, the adept in
mysterious knowledge, the recluse who hid his love of solitude under a
monkish veil. This was Ivan! Young, superb, a man who must be
loved. Fleta stood still and silent, answering the gaze of those questioning,
serious blue eyes, with the purposeful, rebellious look which
was just now burning in her own. The two stood facing each other for
some moments, without speaking—without, as it seemed, desiring to
speak. But in these moments of silence a measuring of strength was
made. Fleta spoke first.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Why have you come?” she demanded. “I did not desire your
presence.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have questions to ask which I alone can answer.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are the one person who cannot answer them, for I cannot ask
them of you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is of me that you must ask them,” was all Ivan’s reply. Then he
added: “It is of me you have to learn these answers. Learn them by
experience if you like, and blindly. If you care to speak, you shall be
answered in words. This will spare you some pain, and save you years
of wasted time. Are you too proud?”</p>

<p class='c028'>There was a pause. Then Fleta replied deliberately:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, I am too proud.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Ivan bowed his head and turned away. He stooped over Father
Amyot, and taking a flask from his pocket, rubbed some liquid on the
monk’s white and rigid lips.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I forbid you,” said Ivan, “to use your power over Amyot again.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You forbid me?” repeated Fleta in a tone of profound amazement.
Evidently this tone was entirely new to her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, and you dare not disobey me. If you do, you will suffer
instantly.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Fleta looked the amazement which was evidently beyond her power
to express in words. Ivan’s manner was cold, almost harsh. Never
had he addressed her without gentleness before. Hastily she recovered
herself, and without pausing to address to him any other word she
turned away and went quickly through the trees and back to the house.
Otto was standing at one of the windows; she went straight to him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I wish to go back to the city at once,” she said, “will you order my
horses?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“May I come with you?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, but you may follow me to-morrow if you like.”</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c023'>I.</h4>

<p class='c035'>Thanks to the light which is now reaching us from the far East
through the Theosophical organs published in the West, it is
easy to foresee that the Catholic teaching is about to undergo a
transformation as profound as it will be glorious. All our dogmas will
pass from “the letter which killeth” to “the spirit which giveth life,” from
the mystic and sacramental to the scientific and rational form, perhaps
even to the stage of experimental methods.</p>

<p class='c028'>The reign of faith, of mystery and of miracle, is nearing its close; this
is plain and was, moreover, predicted by Christ himself. Faith vanishes
from the brains of men of science, to make way for the clear perception
of the essential truths which had to be veiled at the origin of
Christianity, under symbols and figures, so as to adapt them, as far as
possible, to the needs and weaknesses of the infancy of our faith.</p>

<p class='c028'>Strange! It is at the very hour when Europe is attaining the age of
reason, and when she is visibly entering upon the full possession of her
powers, that India prepares to hand on to us those loftier ideas which
exactly meet our new wants, as much from the intellectual, as from the
moral, religious, social and other standpoints.</p>

<p class='c028'>One might believe that the “<span class='sc'>Brothers</span>” kept an eye from afar on the
movements of Christendom, and that from the summits of their
Himalayan watch towers, they had waited expectantly for the hour
when they would be able to make us hear them with some chance of
being understood....</p>

<p class='c028'>It is certain that the situation in the West is becoming more and
more serious. Everyone knows whence comes the imminence of the
catastrophe which threatens us; hitherto men have only evoked the
animal needs, they have only awakened and unchained the brute forces
of nature, the passional instincts, the savage energies of the lower
Kosmos. Christianity does indeed conceal under the profound esotericism
of its Parables, those truths, scientific, religious, and social, which
this deplorable situation imperiously demands, but sad to say, sad indeed
for a priest, hard, hard indeed for Christian ears to hear, all our priesthoods,
that of the Roman Catholic Church equally with those of the
Orthodox Russian, the Anglican, the Protestant, and the Anglo-American
churches, seem struck with blindness and impotence in face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>of the glorious task which they would have to fulfil in these terrible
circumstances. They see nothing; their eyes are plastered and their
ears walled up. They do not discover; one is tempted to say, they do
not even suspect what ineffable truths are hidden under the dead letter
of their teachings.</p>

<p class='c035'>Say, is it not into that darkness that we are all stumbling, in State
and in Church, in politics as in religion! A double calamity forming
but one for the peoples, which suffer horribly under it, and for our
civilisation which may be shipwrecked on it at any moment. May God
deliver us from a war at this moment! It would be a cataclysm in
which Europe would break to pieces in blood and fire, as Montesquieu
foresaw: “Europe will perish through the soldiers, if not saved in time.”
We must escape from this empiricism and this fearful confusion. But
who will save us? The Christ, the true Christ, the Christ of esoteric
science.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c013'><sup>[126]</sup></a> And how? Thus: the same key which, under the eyes of
the scientific bodies, shall open the secrets of Nature, will open their
own intellects to the secrets of true Sociology; the same key which,
under the eyes of the priesthoods, shall open the Arcana of the mysteries
and the gospel parables, will open their intellects to these same secrets
of Sociology. Priests and savants will then develope in the radiance of
one and the same light.</p>

<p class='c028'>And this key—I can assert it, for I have proved it in application to
all our dogmas—<span class='sc'>this key is the same which the Mahatmas
offer and deliver to us at this moment</span>.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c013'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>There is here an interposition of Providence, before which we should
all of us offer up our own thanksgivings. For my part, I am deeply
touched by it; I feel I know not what sacred thrill! My gratitude is
the more keen since, if I confront the Hindu tradition with the occult
theosophic traditions of Judeo-Christianity, from its origin to our own
day, through the Holy Kabbala, I can recognise clearly the agreement
of the teaching of the “Brothers” with the esoteric teaching of Moses,
Jesus, and Saint Paul.</p>

<p class='c028'>People are sure to say: “You abase the West before the East, Europe
before Asia, France before India, Christianity before Buddhism. You
are betraying at once your Country and your Church, your quality as a
Frenchman, and your character as a Priest.” Pardon me, gentlemen!
I abase nothing whatever; I betray nothing at all! A member of
Humanity, I work for the happiness of Humanity; a son of France, I
work for the glory of France; a Priest of Jesus Christ, I work for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>triumph of Jesus Christ. You shall be forced to confess it; suspend,
therefore, your anathemas, and listen, if you please!</p>

<p class='c028'>We are traversing a frightful crisis. For the last hundred years we
have been trying to round the <em>Cape of Social Tempests</em>, which I spoke of
before; we have been enduring, without intermission, the fires, the
lightnings the thunders, and the earthquakes of an unparalleled hurricane,
and we feel, clearly enough, that everything is giving way around us;
under our feet and over our heads! Neither pontiffs, nor savants, nor
politicians, nor statesmen, show themselves capable of snatching us from
the abysses towards which we are being, one is tempted to say, driven
by a fatality! If, then, I discover, in the distant East, through the
darkness of this tempest, the blessed star which alone can guide us,
amidst so many shoals, safe and sound to the longed-for haven of
safety, am I wanting in patriotism and religion because I announce to
my brethren the rising of this beneficent star?...</p>

<p class='c028'>I know as well as you that it was said to Peter: “I <em>will</em> give
thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, that thou mayest open its
gates upon earth”; yes, doubtless, but note the tense of this verb: I <em>will
give</em> thee: in the future. Has the Christian Pontiff already received
them—those magic Keys? Before replying look and see what Rome
has made of Christendom; see the lamentable state of Europe; not
only engaged in open war with foreign nationalities, but also exhausting
herself in fratricidal wars and preparations to consummate her own
destruction; behold everywhere Christian against Christian, church
against church, priesthood against priesthood, class against class, school
against school, and, often in the same family, brother against brother,
sons against their father, the father against his sons! What a spectacle!
And a Pope presides over it! And while, all around, men prepare for a
general slaughter, he, the Pope, thinks only of one thing—of his temporal
domain, of his material possessions! Think you that this state of things
forms the Kingdom of Heaven, and say you still that the Pontiff of Rome
has already received the Keys thereof?</p>

<p class='c028'>It is written, perchance, in the decrees of Providence, that these mysterious
Keys shall be brought to the brethren of the West by the
“Brothers” of the East.... Such is, indeed, the expectation of all
the nations; the prophetic East sighs for the tenth incarnation of
Vishnu, which shall be the crown of all the Avatars which have preceded
it, and the Apocalypse, on its side, announces the appearance of
the <em>White Horse</em> which is the symbol of the Christ risen, glorious and
triumphant before the eyes of all the peoples of the earth.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is how I, priest of Jesus Christ, betray Jesus Christ, when I
acclaim the wisdom of the Mahatmas and their mission in the
West!</p>

<p class='c028'>I have spoken of the opportuneness of the hour chosen by them for
coming to our help. I must insist upon this point.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>[<em>The Abbé then enforces his argument by references to the position of
Modern Science, and concludes</em>:—<span class='sc'>Tr.</span>]</p>

<p class='c028'>“The phenomena of motion,” by means of which men of science claim
to explain everything, explain nothing at all, because the very cause of
that motion is unknown to our physicists as they themselves admit.
“Consider, say to us the Mahatmas by the mouth of their Adepts, that
behind each physical energy is hidden another energy, which itself
serves as envelope to a spiritual force which is the living soul of every
manifested force.”</p>

<p class='c028'>And thus Nature offers us an infinite series of forces one within
another, serving mutually as sheaths, which, as d’Alembert suspected,
produce all sensible phenomena and reach all points of the circumference
starting from a central point, which is God....</p>

<h4 class='c023'>II.</h4>

<p class='c035'>I can now, after these preliminaries, give an example of the transformation
which, thanks to the Mahatmas, will soon take place in the
teaching of the Christian Church. I will take particularly the dogma
of the <em>Creation</em>, informing my readers that they will find in a book I am
preparing, <em>The New Heavens and the New Earth</em>, an analogous work on
all the dogmas of the Catholic faith.</p>

<p class='c028'>Matter exists in states of infinite variety, and, sometimes, even of
opposite appearance. The world is constituted in two poles, the North
or Spiritual, and the South or Material pole: these two poles correspond
perfectly and differ only in form, that is, in appearance.</p>

<p class='c028'>Regarded from above, as the Easterns regard it, the universal
substance presents the aspect of a spiritual or divine <em>emanation</em>; looked
at from below, as the Westerns are in the habit of viewing it, it offers,
on the contrary, the aspect of a material creation.</p>

<p class='c028'>One sees at once the difference which must exist between the two
intellectualities and, consequently, between the two civilisations of the
East and the West. Yet there is no more error in the Genesis of Moses,
which is that of the Christian teaching, than there is in the Genesis of
the Mahatmas, which is that of the Buddhist doctrine. The one and
the other of these Geneses are absolutely founded on one and the same
reality. Whether one descends or ascends the scale of being, one only
traverses, in the East from above downwards, in the West from below
upwards, the same ladder of essences, more or less spiritualised, more
or less materialised, according as one approaches to, or recedes from,
<em>Pure Spirit</em>, which is God.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was, therefore, not worth while to fulminate so much on one side or
the other, here, against the theory of <em>emanation</em>, there, against the theory
of <em>Creation</em>. One always comes back to the principle of Hermes
Trismegistus: the universe is dual, though formed of a single substance.
The Kabbalists knew it well, and it was taught long ago in the Egyptian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>sanctuaries, as the occultists have never ceased to repeat it in the temples
of India.</p>

<p class='c028'>It will soon be demonstrated, I hope, by scientific experiments such
as those of Mr. William Crookes, the Academician, that everywhere,
throughout all nature, <em>spirit</em> and <em>matter</em> are not <em>two</em> but <em>one</em>, and that
they nowhere offer a real division in life. Under every physical force
there is a spiritual or a psychic force: in the heart of the minutest atom
is hidden a vital soul, the presence of which has been perfectly
determined by Claude Bernard in germs imperceptible to the naked
eye. “This soul, human, animal, vegetal or mineral, is but a ray lent by
the universal soul to every object manifested in the Kosmos.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Corporeal man and the sensible universe, says the theosophical
doctrine, are but the appearance imparted to them by the cohesion of
the interatomic or inter-astral forces which constitute both exteriorly.
The visible side of a being is an ever-changing Maya.” The language
of St. Paul is in no way different: “The aspect of the world,” he says,
“is a passing vision, an image which passes and renews itself continually—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>transit
figura hujus mundi</i>.</span>”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The real man, or the <em>microcosm</em>—and one can say as much of the
<em>macrocosm</em>—is an astral force which reveals itself through this physical
appearance, and which, having existed before the birth of this form,
does not share its fate at the hour of death: surviving its destruction.
The material form cannot subsist <a id='corr372.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='withont'>without</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_372.23'><ins class='correction' title='withont'>without</ins></a></span> the spiritual force which
sustains it; but the latter is independent of the former, for form is
created by spirit, and not spirit by form.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This theory is word for word that of the “Brothers” and the Adepts,
at the same time it is that of the Kabbalists and the Christians of the
School of Origen, and the Johannine Church.</p>

<p class='c028'>There could not be a more perfect agreement. Transfer this teaching
to the genesis of the Kosmos and you have the secret of the formation of
the World; at the same time you discover the profound meaning of
the saying of St. Paul: “The invisible things of God are made visible
to the eye of man through the visible things of the creation,” a saying
so well translated by Joseph de Maistre by the following: “The world
is a vast system of invisible things, visibly organised.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The whole of the Kosmos is like a two-faced medal of which both
faces are alike. The materialists know only the lower side, while the
occultists see it from both sides at once; from the front and from the
back. It is always nature, and the same nature, but <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>natura naturata</i></span> from
below, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>natura naturans</i></span> from above; here, intelligent cause; there, brute
effect; spiritual above, corporeal below, etherealised at the North, concreted
at the South Pole.</p>

<p class='c028'>The distinction accepted everywhere in the West down to our own
day, as essential and radical, between spirit on the one hand and matter
on the other, is no longer sustainable. The progress of science, spurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>on as it will be by Hindu ideas, will soon force the last followers of this
infantile belief to abandon it as ridiculous....</p>

<p class='c028'>Yes, all, absolutely all in the world is life, but life differently organised
and variously manifested through phenomena which vary infinitely
from the most spiritualised beings, such as the Angels, as well known to
Buddhists as to Christians, though called by other names, down to the
most solidified of beings, such as stones and metals. In the bosom of
the latter, sleep, in a cataleptic condition, milliards of vital elementary
spirits. These latter only await, to thrill into activity, the stroke of the
pick or hammer to which they will owe their deliverance and their
escape from the <em>limbus</em>, of which the Hindu doctrine speaks as well as
the Catholic. Here lies, for these souls of life, the starting point of the
<em>Resurrection</em> and of the <em>Ascension</em>, taught equally by both the Eastern
and the Western traditions, but not understood among us.</p>

<p class='c028'>[<i>The Abbé sketches in eloquent words the development of these “spirits
of the elements,” and then continues</i>:—<span class='sc'>Tr.</span>]</p>

<p class='c028'>But as they ascend, so the spirits can also descend, for they are always
free to transfigure themselves in the divine light, or to bury themselves
in the satanic shadow of error and evil. Hence, while time is time,
“these ceaseless tears and gnashings of teeth” of which the gospel
Parables speak metaphorically, and which will last as long as shall last
the elaboration of the social atoms destined for the collective composition
of the beatific Nirvana.</p>

<p class='c028'>Nature is ever placing under our eyes examples of organic transformations,
analagous to those I am speaking of, as if to aid us in comprehending
our own destiny. But it seems that many men “have eyes in
order not to see,” as Jesus said. See how in order to remove these
cataracts, science, even in the West, constantly approaching more and
more that of the East, is at work producing in its turn phenomena,
which corroborate at once the Parables of the Gospels and the teachings
of nature. I will not speak of the Salpêtrière and the marvels of hypnotism
in the hands of M. Charcot and his numerous disciples throughout
the whole world. There are things which strike me even more.</p>

<p class='c028'>M. Pictet, at Geneva, is creating diamonds with air and light. This
should not astonish those who know that our coal mines are nothing but
“stored-up sunlight.” With an even more marvellous industry, do not
the flowers extract from the atmosphere the luminous substance of which
they weave their fine and joyous garments? And “all that is sown in
the earth under a material form, does it not rise under a spiritual form,”
as St. Paul says?</p>

<p class='c028'>The glorious entities, which we call celestial spirits, have themselves an
organic <a id='corr373.42'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='form,'>form.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_373.42'><ins class='correction' title='form,'>form.</ins></a></span> It is defined in the canons of our dogma, whatever the
ignorance-mongers of ultramontanism may pretend. God alone has no
body, God alone is <em>pure Spirit</em>—and even to speak thus we must consider
the Deity apart from the person of Jesus Christ, for in the “<em>Word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>made flesh</em>” God dwells <em>corporeally</em>, according to the true and beautiful
saying of St. Paul.</p>

<p class='c028'>And it is because God has no body that he is present everywhere in
the infinite, under the veils of cosmic light and ether, which serve as his
garment and under the electric, magnetic, interatomic, interplanetary,
interstellar and sound fluids, which serve him as vehicles....</p>

<p class='c028'>And it is also because God has no created form that the Kabbala
could, without error, call him <em>Non-Being</em>. Hegel probably felt this esoteric
truth when he spoke, in his heavy and cumbrous language, of the
equivalence of Being and Non-Being.</p>

<p class='c028'>All visible forms are thus the product, at the same time as they are
the garment and the manifestation, of spiritual forces. All sensible order
is, in reality, an <em>organic concretion</em>, a sort of living <em>crystallisation</em> of
intelligent powers fallen from the state of <em>spirituality</em> into the state of
materiality; in other words, fallen from the North to the South pole of
nature, in consequence of a catastrophe called by Holy Scripture the
<em>Fall from Eden</em>. This cataclysm was the punishment of a frightful
crime, of an audacious revolt spoken of in the traditions of all Temples
and called in our dogma <em>original sin</em>. The primary priesthood of the
Christian church has hitherto lacked the light needed to explain this
biological phenomenon, which is an ascertained fact of physiology and
sociology, as I hope to prove. Questioned on this point, the priests have
always replied: It is a mystery. Now there are no mysteries save for
ignorance, and the Christ announced that “every hidden thing should be
brought to light, and proclaimed on the house-tops.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is why so many new lights, coming from the East and elsewhere,
enter scientifically, in our day, into the Christian mind. Glory to the
Theosophists, glory to the Adepts, glory to the Kabbalists, glory above
all to the Hermetists everywhere, glory to those new missionaries whose
coming M. de Maistre foresaw, and whom M. de Saint-Ives d’Alveydre
lately hailed as the elect of God, charged by him to establish a
communion of knowledge and of love between all the religious centres
of the earth!</p>

<p class='c028'>Priests of the Roman Catholic Church, we shall enter in our turn this
wise communion of saints, on the day when we shall consent to read
anew our sacred texts, no longer in “the dead letter” of their
exotericism, but in the “living spirit” of their esotericism, and in the
threefold sense which Christian tradition has always canonically recognised
in them.</p>

the necessity of re-incarnation for ordinary worldly men, and
even for those who are not constant in their detachment and devotion,
but he denies the necessity for that series of trials and initiations which

It would appear as if the theory of evolution might be called in, to
aid this latter view. If it is acknowledged that we, as individuals,
have been for ever whirling on the wheel of conditioned existence;
if at the beginning of each manwantara the divine monad which
through the beginningless past has inhabited in succession the vegetable,
animal, and human forms, takes to itself a house of flesh in exact
accordance with previous Karma, it will be seen that (while inhabiting
a human body) during no moment in the past eternity have we been
nearer the attainment of Nirvana than at any other. If then there
is no thinkable connection between evolution and Nirvana, to imagine
that evolution, through stages of Adeptship, conducts to Nirvana,
is a delusion. “It is purely a question of divine grace”—says the
Religionist. If in answer to this view, it is contended that the light
of the Logos is bound, eventually, to reach and enlighten every
individual, and that the steady progress to perfection through Chelaship
and Adeptship would, therefore, be a logical conclusion, it is objected
that to assert that the light of the Logos must eventually reach and enlighten
all, would involve the ultimate extinction of the objective
Universe, which is admitted to be without beginning or end, although it
passes through alternate periods of manifestation and non-manifestation.
If to escape from this untenable position we postulate fresh emanations
of Deity into the lowest organisms at the beginning of each manwantara,
to take the place of those who pass away into Nirvana, we are met by
other difficulties. Firstly, putting out of consideration the fact that
such a supposition is expressly denied by what is acknowledged as
revelation, the projection into the evolutionary process of a monad free
from all Karma, makes the law of Karma inoperative, for the monad’s
first association with Karma remains unexplained; and also it becomes
impossible to say what the monad was, and what was the mode of its
being prior to the projection into evolution. It must be noted that
although the law of Karma does not explain <em>why</em> we are, yet it satisfactorily
shows <em>how</em> we are what we are; and this is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> of
the law. But the above theory takes away its occupation. It makes
Karma and the monad independent realities, joined together by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>creative energy of the Deity, while Karma ought to be regarded as a
mode of existence of the monad—which mode ceases to be when
another mode, called liberation, takes its place. Secondly, if the monad
in attaining liberation only attains to what it was before its association
with Karma, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>à quoi bon</i></span> the whole process; while, if it is stated that the
monad was altogether non-existent before its projection, the Deity
becomes responsible for all our sufferings and sins, and we fall into
either the Calvinist doctrine of predestination as popularly conceived,
or into the still more blasphemous doctrine of the worshippers of
Ahriman, besides incurring many logical difficulties. The teaching of
our eastern philosophers is that the real interior nature of the monad
is the same as the real interior essence of the Godhead, but from
beginningless past time it has a transitory nature, considered illusive,
and the mode in which this illusion works is known by the name of
Karma.</p>

<p class='c028'>But were we not led astray in the first instance? Ought we not to
have acquiesced in the first above given definition of the theory of
evolution? The premiss was satisfactory enough—the mistake was in
allowing the religionist’s deduction as a logical necessity. When the
religionist states that there is no thinkable connection between evolution
and Nirvana, he merely postulates for the word evolution a more
limited scope than that which the Occultist attaches to it, viz., the
development of soul as well as that of mere form. He is indeed right
in stating that the natural man, while he remains such, will never
attain the ultimate goal of Being. True it is, for the Occultist as for
the religionist, that, to free himself from the fatal circle of rebirths, he
must “burst the shell which holds him in darkness—tear the veil that
hides him from the eternal.” The religionist may call this the act of
divine grace; but it may be quite as correctly described as the
“awakening of the slumbering God within.” But the error of the
religionist is surely in mistaking the first glimmer of the divine
consciousness for a guarantee of final emancipation, at, say, the next
death of the body, instead of merely the first step of a probationary
stage in the long vista of work for Humanity on the higher planes of
Being!</p>

<p class='c028'>To provide ourselves with an analogy from the very theory of Evolution
which we have been discussing, is it not more logical to imagine
that, in the same way in which we see stretched at our feet the infinite
gradations of existence, through the lower animal, vegetable, and
mineral kingdoms—between which indeed, thanks to the recent
investigations of scientific men—there is no longer recognised to be any
distinct line of demarcation—so the heights (necessarily hidden from our
view) which still remain to be scaled by us in our upward progress to
Divinity, should be similarly filled with the gradations of the unseen
hierarchy of Being? And that, as we have evolved during millions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>centuries of earth-life through these lower forms up to the position we
now occupy, so may we, if we choose, start on a new and better road of
progress, apart from the ordinary evolution of Humanity, but in which
there must also be innumerable grades?</p>

<p class='c028'>That there will be progress for Humanity as a whole, in the direction
of greater spirituality, there is no doubt, but that progress will be partaken
of by continually decreasing numbers. Whether the weeding out
takes place at the middle of the “great fifth round,” or whether it be
continually taking place during the evolutionary process, a ray of light
is here thrown on the statement met with in all the Bibles of Humanity
as to the great difficulty of the attainment. “For straight is the gate,
and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find
it; but wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth unto destruction,
and many there be that go in thereat.” This and parallel
passages doubtless refer to the weeding out of those who are unfit to
continue the progress, on which the more spiritualized Humanity will
then have entered. The most vivid picture of the comparative handful
of elect souls, who are fit to achieve the great quest, will be obtained by
contemplating the fact already stated, that the objective universe, with
its myriads of inhabitants, will never, in the vast abysses of the future,
cease to be; and that the great majority of humanity—the millions of
millions—will thus for ever whirl on the wheel of birth and death.</p>

<p class='c028'>But though Nature may give us an almost infinite number of chances
to attempt the great quest, it were madness to put by the chance offered
now, and allow the old sense-attractions to regain their dominance, for
it must be remembered that the barbarism and anarchy which every
civilisation must eventually lapse into, are periods of spiritual deadness,
and that it is when “the flower of civilisation has blown to its full, and
when its petals are but slackly held together,” that the goad within men
causes them to lift their eyes to the sunlit mountains, and “to recognise
in the bewildering glitter the outlines of the Gates of Gold.”</p>

<p class='c028'>There are no doubt realms in the Devaloka where the bliss of heaven
may be realised by those who aspire to the selfish rewards of personal
satisfaction, but these cease to exist with the end of the manwantara,
and with the beginning of the next the devotee will again have to endure
incarceration in flesh. The eighth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita does
indeed state that there is a path to Nirvana through the Devaloka, and
amongst the countless possibilities of the Infinite who shall assert that this
is not so? but the context surely implies such a detachment and devotion
through life as is difficult for us even to contemplate, much less to
realize.</p>

<p class='c028'>However distant, therefore, may appear to us the achievement of the
great quest, when we consider how much more closely we are allied to
the animal than to the God, it must necessarily seem an infinitely far-off
goal, but though we may have to pass through many life-times before we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>reach it, our most earnest prayer should be, that we may never lose
sight of that celestial goal, for surely it is the one thing worthy of
achievement!</p>

<p class='c028'>To many the foregoing may appear as mere speculations, and the
firmest faith indeed can scarcely call itself knowledge, but, however
necessary the complete knowledge may be, we may at least hope that
its partial possession is adequate to the requirements of the occasion.
To us whose feet tread, often wearily, towards the path of the great
quest, and whose eyes strain blindly through the mists that wrap us
round, steady perseverance and omnipotent hope must be the watch-words—perseverance
to struggle on, though the fiends of the lower self
may make every step a battle, and hope that at any moment the entrance
to the path may be found.</p>

<p class='c028'>As an example of these two qualities, and also because all words that
strike a high key are bound to awaken responsive echoes in noble hearts,
let us conclude with the following extract from the Ramayana:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“Thus spoke Rama. Virtue is a service man owes himself, and
though there were no heaven nor any God to rule the world, it were not
less the binding law of life. It is man’s privilege to know the right and
follow it. Betray and persecute me brother men! Pour out your rage
on me O malignant devils! Smile, or watch my agony in cold disdain
ye blissful Gods! Earth, hell, heaven combine your might to crush me—I
will still hold fast by this inheritance! My strength is nothing—time
can shake and cripple it; my youth is transient—already grief has
withered up my days; my heart—alas! it is well-nigh broken now.
Anguish may crush it utterly, and life may fail; but even so my soul
that has not tripped shall triumph, and dying, give the lie to soulless
destiny that dares to boast itself man’s master.”</p>

the power to wound.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>Those who give a merely passing and superficial attention to the
subject of occultism—and their name is Legion—constantly
inquire why, if adepts in life exist, they do not appear in the
world and show their power. That the chief body of these wise ones
should be understood to dwell beyond the fastnesses of the Himalayas,
appears to be a sufficient proof that they are only figures of straw.
Otherwise, why place them so far off?</p>

<p class='c028'>Unfortunately, Nature has done this and not personal choice or
arrangement. There are certain spots on the earth where the advance
of “civilisation” is unfelt, and the nineteenth century fever is kept at
bay. In these favoured places there is always time, always opportunity,
for the realities of life; they are not crowded out by the doings of an
inchoate, money-loving, pleasure seeking society. While there are
adepts upon the earth, the earth must preserve to them places of
seclusion. This is a fact in nature which is only an external expression
of a profound fact in super-nature.</p>

<p class='c028'>The demand of the neophyte remains unheard until the voice in which it
is uttered has lost the power to wound. This is because the divine-astral
life<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c013'><sup>[128]</sup></a> is a place in which order reigns, just as it does in natural life. There
is, of course, always the centre and the circumference as there is in nature.
Close to the central heart of life, on any plane, there is knowledge, there
order reigns completely; and chaos makes dim and confused the
outer margin of the circle. In fact, life in every form bears a more or
less strong resemblance to a philosophic school. There are always the
devotees of knowledge who forget their own lives in their pursuit of it;
there are always the flippant crowd who come and go——Of such,
Epictetus said that it was as easy to teach them philosophy as to eat
custard with a fork. The same state exists in the super-astral life; and
the adept has an even deeper and more profound seclusion there in
which to dwell. This place of retreat is so safe, so sheltered, that no
sound which has discord in it can reach his ears. Why should this be,
will be asked at once, if he is a being of such great powers as those say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>who believe in his existence? The answer seems very apparent. He
serves humanity and identifies himself with the whole world; he is
ready to make vicarious sacrifice for it at any moment—<em>by living not by
dying for it</em>. Why should he not die for it? Because he is part of the
great whole, and one of the most valuable parts of it. Because he lives
under laws of order which he does not desire to break. His life is not
his own, but that of the forces which work behind him. He is the flower
of humanity, the bloom which contains the divine seed. He is, in his
own person, a treasure of the universal nature, which is guarded and
made safe in order that the fruition shall be perfected. It is only at definite
periods of the world’s history that he is allowed to go among the herd
of men as their redeemer. But for those who have the power to separate
themselves from this herd he is always at hand. And for those who
are strong enough to conquer the vices of the personal human nature, as
set forth in these four rules, he is consciously at hand, easily recognised,
ready to answer.</p>

<p class='c028'>But this conquering of self implies a destruction of qualities which
most men regard as not only indestructible but desirable. The “power
to wound” includes much that men value, not only in themselves, but in
others. The instinct of self-defence and of self-preservation is part of
it; the idea that one has any right or rights, either as citizen, or man, or
individual, the pleasant consciousness of self-respect and of virtue.
These are hard sayings to many; yet they are true. For these words
that I am writing now, and those which I have written on this subject,
are not in any sense my own. They are drawn from the traditions of
the lodge of the Great Brotherhood, which was once the secret splendour
of Egypt. The rules written in its ante-chamber were the same as those
now written in the ante-chamber of existing schools. Through all time
the wise men have lived apart from the mass. And even when some
temporary purpose or object induces one of them to come into the
midst of human life, his seclusion and safety is preserved as completely
as ever. It is part of his inheritance, part of his position, he has an
actual title to it, and can no more put it aside than the Duke of
Westminster can say he does not choose to be the Duke of Westminster.
In the various great cities of the world an adept lives for a while from
time to time, or perhaps only passes through; but all are occasionally
aided by the actual power and presence of one of these men. Here in
London, as in Paris and St. Petersburgh, there are men high in development.
But they are only known as mystics by those who have the
power to recognise; the power given by the conquering of self. Otherwise
how could they exist, even for an hour, in such a mental and
psychic atmosphere as is created by the confusion and disorder of a
city? Unless protected and made safe their own growth would be
interfered with, their work injured. And the neophyte may meet an
adept in the flesh, may live in the same house with him, and yet be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>unable to recognise him, and unable to make his own voice heard by
him. For no nearness in space, no closeness of relations, no daily
intimacy, can do away with the inexorable laws which give the adept
his seclusion. No voice penetrates to his inner hearing till it has become
a divine voice, a voice which gives no utterance to the cries of self.
Any lesser appeal would be as useless, as much a waste of energy and
power, as for mere children who are learning their alphabet to be taught
it by a professor of philology. Until a man has become, in heart and
spirit, a disciple, he has no existence for those who are teachers of
disciples. And he becomes this by one method only—the surrender of
his personal humanity.</p>

<p class='c028'>For the voice to have lost the power to wound, a man must have
reached that point where he sees himself only as one of the vast multitudes
that live; one of the sands washed hither and thither by the sea
of vibratory existence. It is said that every grain of sand in the ocean
bed does, in its turn, get washed up on to the shore and lie for a moment
in the sunshine. So with human beings, they are driven hither and
thither by a great force, and each, in his turn, finds the sunrays on him.
When a man is able to regard his own life as part of a whole like this he
will no longer struggle in order to obtain anything for himself. This is
the surrender of personal rights. The ordinary man expects, not to
take equal fortunes with the rest of the world, but in some points, about
which he cares, to fare better than the others. The disciple does not
expect this. Therefore, though he be, like Epictetus, a chained slave, he
has no word to say about it. He knows that the wheel of life turns
ceaselessly. Burne Jones has shown it in his marvellous picture—the
wheel turns, and on it are bound the rich and the poor, the great and the
small—each has his moment of good fortune when the wheel brings him
uppermost—the King rises and falls, the poet is <em>fêted</em> and forgotten, the
slave is happy and afterwards discarded. Each in his turn is crushed as
the wheel turns on. The disciple knows that this is so, and though it is
his duty to make the utmost of the life that is his, he neither complains
of it nor is elated by it, nor does he complain against the better fortune of
others. All alike, as he well knows, are but learning a lesson; and he
smiles at the socialist and the reformer who endeavour by sheer force
to re-arrange circumstances which arise out of the forces of human
nature itself. This is but kicking against the pricks; a waste of life and
energy.</p>

<p class='c028'>In realising this a man surrenders his imagined individual rights, of
whatever sort. That takes away one keen sting which is common to all
ordinary men.</p>

<p class='c028'>When the disciple has fully recognised that the very thought of individual
rights is only the outcome of the venomous quality in himself,
that it is the hiss of the snake of self which poisons with its sting his own
life and the lives of those about him, then he is ready to take part in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>yearly ceremony which is open to all neophytes who are prepared for it.
All weapons of defence and offence are given up; all weapons of mind
and heart, and brain, and spirit. Never again can another man be
regarded as a person who can be criticised or condemned; never again
can the neophyte raise his voice in self-defence or excuse. From that
ceremony he returns into the world as helpless, as unprotected, as a newborn
child. That, indeed, is what he is. He has begun to be born
again on to the higher plane of life, that breezy and well-lit plateau from
whence the eyes see intelligently and regard the world with a new
insight.</p>

<p class='c028'>I have said, a little way back, that after parting with the sense of
individual rights, the disciple must part also with the sense of self-respect
and of virtue. This may sound a terrible doctrine, yet all occultists
know well that it is not a doctrine, but a fact. He who thinks himself
holier than another, he who has any pride in his own exemption from
vice or folly, he who believes himself wise, or in any way superior to
his fellow men, is incapable of discipleship. A man must become as a
little child before he can enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c028'>Virtue and wisdom are sublime things; but if they create pride and a
consciousness of separateness from the rest of humanity in the mind of a
man, then they are only the snakes of self re-appearing in a finer form.
At any moment he may put on his grosser shape and sting as fiercely as
when he inspired the actions of a murderer who kills for gain or hatred,
or a politician who sacrifices the mass for his own or his party’s interests.</p>

<p class='c028'>In fact, to have lost the power to wound, implies that the snake is not
only scotched, but killed. When it is merely stupefied or lulled to sleep
it awakes again and the disciple uses his knowledge and his power for
his own ends, and is a pupil of the many masters of the black art, for
the road to destruction is very broad and easy, and the way can be
found blindfold. That it is the way to destruction is evident, for when a
man begins to live for self he narrows his horizon steadily till at last the
fierce driving inwards leaves him but the space of a pin’s-head to dwell
in. We have all seen this phenomenon occur in ordinary life. A man
who becomes selfish isolates himself, grows less interesting and less
agreeable to others. The sight is an awful one, and people shrink from
a very selfish person at last, as from a beast of prey. How much more
awful is it when it occurs on the more advanced plane of life, with the
added powers of knowledge, and through the greater sweep of successive
incarnations!</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore I say, pause and think well upon the threshold. For if the
demand of the neophyte is made without the complete purification, it will
not penetrate the seclusion of the divine adept, but will evoke the
terrible forces which attend upon the black side of our human nature.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Before the soul can stand in the presence of the Masters its feet must be washed
in the blood of the heart.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The word soul, as used here, means the divine soul, or “starry
spirit.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“To be able to stand is to have confidence;” and to have confidence
means that the disciple is sure of himself, that he has surrendered his
emotions, his very self, even his humanity; that he is incapable of fear
and unconscious of pain; that his whole consciousness is centred in the
divine life, which is expressed symbolically by the term “the Masters;”
that he has neither eyes, nor ears, nor speech, nor power, save in and
for the divine ray on which his highest sense has touched. Then is he
fearless, free from suffering, free from anxiety or dismay; his soul
stands without shrinking or desire of postponement, in the full blaze of
the divine light which penetrates through and through his being. Then
he has come into his inheritance and can claim his kinship with the
teachers of men; he is upright, he has raised his head, he breathes the
same air that they do.</p>

<p class='c028'>But before it is in any way possible for him to do this, the feet of the
soul must be washed in the blood of the heart.</p>

<p class='c028'>The sacrifice, or surrender of the heart of man, and its emotions, is
the first of the rules; it involves the “attaining of an equilibrium which
cannot be shaken by personal emotion.” This is done by the stoic
philosopher; he, too, stands aside and looks equably upon his own
sufferings, as well as on those of others.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the same way that “tears” in the language of occultists expresses
the soul of emotion, not its material appearance, so blood expresses, not
that blood which is an essential of physical life, but the vital creative
principle in man’s nature, which drives him into human life in order to
experience pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow. When he has let the
blood flow from the heart he stands before the Masters as a pure spirit
which no longer wishes to incarnate for the sake of emotion and
experience. Through great cycles of time successive incarnations in
gross matter may yet be his lot; but he no longer desires them, the
crude wish to live has departed from him. When he takes upon him
man’s form in the flesh he does it in the pursuit of a divine object, to
accomplish the work of “the Masters,” and for no other end. He looks
neither for pleasure nor pain, asks for no heaven, and fears no hell; yet
he has entered upon a great inheritance which is not so much a compensation
for these things surrendered, as a state which simply blots out
the memory of them. He lives now not in the world, but with it; his
horizon has extended itself to the width of the whole universe.</p>

<h4 class='c023'><span class='sc'>Part I.—Ralph’s Story.</span></h4>

<p class='c035'>“It was after this manner, as they say,” began Ralph, swinging
himself on to a bench and pouring out for himself a tankard of
our good home-brewed, as I crouched in the hay opposite to
him. “Two centuries agone and thirty years or so, there dwelt in this
very house which I serve—and which one day, young master, you shall
rule!—Sir Gilbert de Troyes, your ancestor, and his lady, and four fair
sons, and a lovely daughter. Of these sons, twain were at the wars, one
was in his nurse’s lap, and another was gone to Italy, to finish his
studies at Parma. Thus did the old nobles use to ruin their sons!</p>

<p class='c028'>“This young foregoer of yours (a goodly youth!) fell in with the usual
temptations of Satan. He held, with the poets, that the world is the
best book for men to read; and he studied it, I ween, with diligence.
Now there was a certain damsel, winsome enough, I doubt not, in the
Italian style, with black hair and the devil—save the mark!—in her
wandering eyes. So it came to pass that Master Gilbert, younger,
wooed her for his bride, like an honest gentleman, as the old tales say
he was; and so great is the power of one upright soul amongst others,
that the young witch—she was but young, poor soul! and teachable—was
charmed herself from her Italian ways, and vowed to love and follow
only him; and the day before their marriage, she was walking with him
in the streets of Parma, by night—for Master Gilbert had a governor along
with him in Italy, who must be hoodwinked—when there chanced to
espy them one Pietro Rinucci, a clerkly fellow (with a curse upon him!)
who was even studying also at Parma, and who loved the Italian witch
himself.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This Rinucci had been favoured of the girl, and only when she saw
the Englishman, with his blue eyes and his honest ways, had she
scorned her countryman and left him. Rinucci, after the manner of his
race-fellows, then dogged her steps, tracked her to her early meetings
with young Gilbert de Troyes, who was his unsuspecting friend, and
listened to their innocent ravings of love conjoined to virtue.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Afterward, had he gone to the damsel’s poor lodging and there, with
Heaven knows what direful threats! conjured her to renounce her
honest lover and return to himself. The signorina was not like an
English girl—she neither stormed nor yielded—she cajoled and blinded
him. ‘If he would go, she would consider; perchance she did not love
the Briton truly; perchance it was a whim; she knew not. Might she
but think? it was a whirl, and her heart, alas! was o’er susceptible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>’twould pass; he must leave her now, at least, and she would see.
Meantime Pietruccino should wear this pretty crimson ribbon of hers till
they met again.’ After even such words, and for a kiss, he left her.
But the cunning villain was more than her match, and waited all the
next day round the corners, whence he could see her goings out and
comings in. He saw her glide to her trysting-place; he followed
cautiously; he heard her give a signalling whispered call; he heard it
answered by a short, low whistle; young Gilbert de Troyes swung
merrily round the corner and fell into his Italian sweetheart’s arms.</p>

<p class='c028'>“He met his death, poor, noble young fellow! ’Tis an old tale
repeated. I need scarce have wasted all these words upon it—but that
one’s heart must needs ache at these things. In the course of nature
that Italian snake, Rinucci, was bound to finish his rival there and then.
So he got behind the unwary schoolboy—for the lad was, indeed, little
more—and stabbed him, all too deep, in the back of the neck.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Folk say Rinucci triumphed as he set his foot on his dying college-mate,
and wiped his dagger, with a laugh, before the horror-stricken
girl. Myself can scarcely believe it; he was too young in murder then
for that.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Be this as it may, certain it is that he dragged away the mourning
damsel from the corpse of the man who would have saved her soul, and
took her back to himself.</p>

<p class='c028'>“A sickening story, boy. Wilt thou have more, young master?
Yea? Why, there is worse to come. For Mistress Italiana—no
tradition tells her name—was spirited as any gipsy woman, and full of
crafty lore, such as her race delight in. She broke her heart over her
English lover’s corpse; but she had still the Southern amusement left
her of revenge. She concocted an evil greenish powder, and coloured
Signor Pietro’s sweetmeats with it.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The fellow ate largely, praising the daintiness of the confection.
It was deadly enough, I daresay, in all conscience, but it killed him not.
These reptiles live on poison; morally, ’tis certain, belike, and also
physically it agreed with him. Perchance he may have felt a qualm or
two, though tradition says nought of it. Anyway, the next fytte of
this story shows us the mysterious disappearance of the Italian girl, of
whom no word hath ever since been told.</p>

<p class='c028'>“She left behind her, whether willingly or no, a quantity of the
false seasoning, which Master Pietro had caused to be analysed, and
which he seems to have carefully preserved.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Some time after these events, we find Signor Pietro Rinucci
entered into the Monastery of Dominicans at Brescia, a repentant
neophyte. He had turned remorseful, no doubt, and in good time!
The fellow had ever strong imaginations. He was received in due time
as a brother; wore the garb of the Order, and cast his eyes down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>Tradition saith he was in great turmoil of soul at this time—judge for
yourself, young master, by what followed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“One fine morning Brother Petrus was missing from his small,
damp cell, and none could tell what had become of him. None, that is,
save the poverty-stricken ropemaker who had supplied him with cords
to scale the monastery walls; and his discretion had been paid for.
The fact being, I doubt not, that discipline being ever repugnant to our
young bravo’s manners, he had fled it.</p>

<p class='c028'>“In the meantime, the news of Gilbert de Troyes’ death had been
brought to these very doors, and certainly the grooms who then tended
the good horses of your ancestors must, even in this saddle-room, have
spent their sorrow in each other’s company. But Ambrose de Troyes,
newly back from the wars, and second-born of the family, rose in his
wrath, and swore to avenge his brother. For all might know that the
death blow had been dealt by one Pietro Rinucci, fellow-scholar of
Gilbert’s, whose absence afterward from the University had puzzled the
doctors and caused inquisition into the matter.</p>

<p class='c028'>“So away went Ambrose, the soldier, to Parma. And mind ye,
Ambrose was no careless school-boy, no mean foe to a man, but a great,
staunch fellow who had seen service, and who was, moreover, by Nature
something stern and hard of purpose.</p>

<p class='c028'>“But at Parma they told him Rinucci was escaped into a monastery
which they named, and showed a painted portrait of him, and did so
minutely, point by point, describe the man, that Ambrose swore he
should know him, should he meet him in <a id='corr386.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Heaven,'>Heaven.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_386.25'><ins class='correction' title='Heaven,'>Heaven.</ins></a></span> And that was a
strong assertion, note ye.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Well, Ambrose journeyed on towards the secluded spot where the
Monastery of Dominicans lay, and was enforced to rest one night
at the village of Santa Rosa on his road. Having stabled his steed,
refreshed it and himself, and practised his arm some moments with the
good sharp sword, he slung the weapon round him and went forth for a
stroll to pass the time.</p>

<p class='c028'>“He came to the equivalent of what would be to us in England an
ale-house, but some way out of the village, meet for travellers to pause
and rest a moment on their way. Ambrose went in to look about him
and ordered drink for himself. He lacked a companion to pledge, but
looking round the little room saw no one but a moody man who seemed
lost in thought, though enjoying some passing sour wine. Ambrose
himself could stomach neither the fare nor the company, so he quickly
got him on his way a little further; when, meeting with a simple shrine
to the Virgin, the God-fearing soldier took his rosary from under his
baldrick, and knelt him down to pray. For something had sore perplexed
him; he had seemed to see in the features of that morose
comrade at the inn the most exact resemblance of Rinucci. But
Rinucci was safe at the Monastery, waiting till his time should come, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>the avenger should denounce him. But even as he rose from prayer
did Ambrose see a mounted messenger speeding to him, who told
him breathlessly the news had just reached Santa Rosa that the
Monk Petrus was escaped and roaming at large somewhere in the
country.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Then Ambrose de Troyes knew he had his man; and natheless, like
the large-hearted fellow he was, he would but meet him quite alone. So
he rewarded the newsbringer and sent him away. Once more he fell on
his knees before our Lady’s image, and besought that his cause might
find Heaven’s favour, and his action in it be in every point just and
serviceable. (For he looked upon himself as sent to do such things as
might cause his brother’s soul to rest in peace.) Then he went rapidly
retracing his steps towards the inn again, and, led by Destiny, out came
Pietro Rinucci, unarmed, to meet him. Ambrose de Troyes looked into
the assassin’s eyes and knew him. Stranger still, the piercing eyes of
the cunning Italian saw, in the traits of this bronzed warrior, relationship
to the Gilbert who had been his friend and victim.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘I arrest thee, Pietro Rinucci, for the murder of my brother, Gilbert
de Troyes, and, though I may not draw upon a tonsured monk (yea, I
know thee through all thy false disguises!), yet, before I hale thee to
the ecclesiastical courts, I will show thee, snake, what I think of thee,
and of all such!’</p>

<p class='c028'>“And Ambrose de Troyes smote the villain a shameful blow upon the
face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Even at that instant, the monk whips <a id='corr387.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>me</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_387.25'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>me</ins></a></span> Ambrose’s sword from its
scabbard, and, with the fatal dexterity of his race, ran in upon the
stately Englishman and laid him, bleeding quick to death, upon the hot
white road.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Oh Margaret, my sister Margaret!’ the dying man raved, as if he
thirsted for help from the hand that had been kind to him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘A right pestilent breed of Britons! but easy to kill—easy to kill,’
quoth the Monk, as he laid down the red sword by the dying man’s side
and left him alone in his agony.</p>

<p class='c028'>“This scene was witnessed by a terrified young country-girl, who
crouched behind a heap of stones, meanwhile, until the murderer’s
flight, and then ran to assist De Troyes, who thought she was his sister
Margaret, and said marvellous tender words, of home and of her
kindness, and of the little brother he had left in the nursery.</p>

<p class='c028'>“After this, there comes a period of Rinucci’s life of which we know
but little. He seems to have raced about the country, in hiding always,
but doing little harm for him. Italy, however, is debateable ground for
one of her own recreant monks, so we find Messer Pietro fleeing Justice
and coming over here to England. Whether he had had some of his heart-searchings
that he knew so often, I know not, but deem it very likely.
Here is the flaw, to my mind, in the foreigners’ constitutions. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>recognize their sins as such, not so we English! We say our evil deeds
are fate, congenital infirmity, ignorance, negligence, or even virtues;
they say their sins are sins, and yet they do them. Had I but half the
talent of sinning that Messer Pietro seems to have owned, my faith, I
would have gloried in it! So did not he, however; he went to a father
confessor, fell on the earth, and implored absolution—for life was still
sweet to him, he said, and he would not die yet awhile.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The father sent him for penance to travel as a pilgrim, in a white
penitential garb to England, there to walk to the shrine of St. Thomas
à Becket, foully slain on earth by violence.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The father did well for his mother-country, but evilly for us.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The monk Petrus performed at all points the penalty enjoined him,
and afterward, having no especial call to Italy again, he followed his
roving instincts and wandered about England, even till chance brought
him to this, our, town. In this country he knew no men well enough to
desire to kill them; besides, at this period, one of his fits of penitence
seems to have been on him. Certes, he wore the monkish habit, only
different in its white colour from that of other fraternities, and the folk
grew acquainted with his white figure as he roamed the land in deepest
meditation, with his eyes bent upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now, one day, say the chronicles (which are made up of village
tales), the White Monk, as our townsfolk called him, was sitting in a
thicket by a brook in which he was bathing his travelled feet, when
there came by the sister of his victims, even Mistress Margaret de
Troyes herself, and walked the pleasant fringes of the forest, very near
to where the wanderer sat, on the further side the elders. She was
accompanied by her mother and by another lady, both of whom were
pressing the claims of some noble suitor upon her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The other ladies were in deepest mourning for Gilbert and for
Ambrose, and Mistress Margaret herself, though she wore no such signs
of grief, was most plainly clad in a pale, pure garb of lavender. She
listened quietly to all they urged, then spoke and said:</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘My mother, he is a light, false man. I care not for him.’</p>

<p class='c028'>“It was protested to her, her high birth, the respect in which he would
hold her for herself; above all, her fair beauty, would all ensure his
faithfulness. But Margaret said:</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘I beseech ye, press me no further. Heaven knows I wish the
gentleman much good, and that he may aspire to higher things. I will
pray for him, weep for him if need be; but, ladies, though I be but a
simple English maiden, I hold myself all too good for such as he to
marry and draw down, perchance, to like thoughts with himself. I hate
all evil—not the doers, mother; but the evil. We are all weak and
changeable, and I dare not come in contact of my free will with evil
influence. God might punish me by weakness of resolve against
infection.’</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>“They urged her yet once more; she might triumph and convert a
soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘In truth,’ confessed fair Margaret de Troyes, ‘ye wound me sorely,
dearest ladies mine! At such a time, when good Ambrose de Troyes
is scarce cold in his grave, to bid his sister make her choice amongst his
townsfolk; and celebrate the marriage feast with a breaking heart! My
Ambrose—to think that thou, who, if I but spake of a moment’s weariness,
would quickly place a cushion for my head, and sit by the hour on our
window-seat chafing my feet, that thou should’st be bleeding in the
death-struggles, on the hard, parched road, in a foreign land, and I be
far away, not able so much as to raise thy dear head upon my knee!
Oh, I loved him so tenderly, strong brother of mine! I gloried in my
brown-maned soldier. We prayed together the night before he left on
his sacred errand, and, at his entreaty, I laid my hand upon his head
and blessed him in Our Lady’s name. He was a grave, good man; and
you would have me turn my thoughts from him to that other! What
though I know Ambrose to be now one of God’s angels; yet he hath
left me behind him on the earth—the first unkindness he hath ever done
me! And his mother and mine would have me think of wedlock!’</p>

<p class='c028'>“The fair, pale Englishwoman bent her head, and Pietro heard her
weeping.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Well, it is but guesswork thenceforth. Folk say, in their coarse way
of speaking, that the White Monk ‘loved’ the lady Margaret. Forfend!
The love of such a man were an insult all too gross to offer to the
memory of any Damoiselle de Troyes. Say, rather, he kindled to the
worship of goodness in that form first of all.</p>

<p class='c028'>“We know that from that hour when he first saw and heard her,
Rinucci, the stained wretch, wandered ever where there was a chance to
see her, even from afar. Once, indeed he even spoke with her.
Under the favour of his sacred garment he dared to near her, and
asked:</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Maiden, how say you? Is there mercy in Heaven for the worst
sinners, or no?’</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Nay, holy father,” answered the damsel, smiling, <a id='corr389.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“thou'>‘thou</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_389.34'><ins class='correction' title='“thou'>‘thou</ins></a></span> must be
better seen in these high mysteries than I who dwell in the world, where
we all need mercy. We can but hope that our God is more pitiful than
are our fellow creatures to our faults.’</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Maiden,’ besought the White Monk further, ‘can such as thou look
pityingly upon a vice-stained fellow man?’</p>

<p class='c028'>“But Margaret wept, and answered him:</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Oh, father, search me not over this problem. I have lost the
dearest to me in the world, two brothers, by an assassin’s hand. If that
man stood before me, tell me, <em>could</em> I look at him forgivingly? Oh,
never, father! Human nature is too weak.’</p>

<p class='c028'>“The rencounter was over, for Pietro dared speak no more. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>according to the custom of that day, Mistress Margaret bent her fair
head to receive the blessing of the holy father.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The monk started back in horror; even he was not too base to
feel that. But as the maiden still stood humbly waiting, he was forced
to stretch his hands forth from the distance, and murmur: ‘Benedicite!’</p>

<p class='c028'>“The days went by and the townsfolk noted how the White Monk
wasted, and how strange he was. He would mutter to himself like a
madman. He never said a word of holy import to the cottagers with
whom he lodged at small cost. He ate almost nothing and appeared to
spend his days in solitary musing. His conduct smacked so oddly of
mania that Giles Hughson, his landlord, took to watching whither he
went and what he did. He saw him always following Margaret, but
seeking to avoid her if she turned where she might see him. He seemed
to dread her greatly, yet, to worship her, or, at least to follow her like a
lost soul looking after the light from some vanishing angel’s wing.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Once Margaret turned and saw him, but recognised him not as the
man she had spoken withal. She, taking him for a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>frère quetant</i></span>, silently,
without looking upon him, pressed into his hand money, which he took,

<p class='c028'>The following remarkable passage was published some five years ago in the
<cite>Theosophist</cite>, of Madras (1883); and it is needless to call attention in more
detail to the fidelity with which it is being since then verified.</p>

<p class='c028'>Protesting against the arbitrary chronology of the Sanskritists in the question
of Indian antiquity who make it dependent on the Greeks and Chandragupta—whose
date is represented as “the sheet-anchor of Indian chronology” that
“nothing will ever shake” (Prof. Max Müller and Weber), the author of the
prophecy remarks that “it is to be feared that as regards India, the chronological
ship of the Sanskritists has already broken from her moorings and gone adrift
with all her precious freight of conjectures and hypotheses.” And then
adds:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“We are at the end of a cycle—geological and other—and at the beginning
of another. Cataclysm is to follow cataclysm. The pent-up forces are bursting
out in many quarters; and not only will men be swallowed up or slain by
thousands, “new” land appear and “old” subside, volcanic eruptions and tidal
waves appal; but secrets of an unsuspected past will be uncovered to the
dismay of Western theorists and the humiliation of an imperious science. This
drifting ship, if watched, may be seen to ground upon the upheaved vestiges of
ancient civilisations, and fall to pieces. We are not emulous of the prophet’s
honours: but still, let this stand as a prophecy.” (See also “<cite>Five Years of
Theosophy</cite>,” p. 388.)</p>

  <h3 class='c018'>LOVE WITH AN OBJECT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>Some distinguished contributors to theosophical literature have of
late been describing what qualities are necessary to constitute a
perfect man, <i>i.e.</i>, an Adept. They said that among other things it
was absolutely and indispensably necessary, that such a being should
possess Love—and not merely Love in the abstract—but love regarding
some object or objects. What can they possibly mean by speaking of
“love with an object,” and could there possibly be love without any
object at all? Can that feeling be called love, which is directed solely
to the Eternal and Infinite, and takes no cognizance of earthly
illusions? Can that be love which has no object or—in other words—is
the love of forms or objects the true love at all? If a man loved all
things in the universe alike, without giving any preference to any of
them, would not such a love be practically without any object; would it
not be equal to loving nothing at all; because in such a case the
individuality of any single object would be lost to sight?</p>

<p class='c028'>A love which is directed towards all things alike, an universal love, is
beyond the conception of the mortal mind, and yet this kind of love,
which bestows no favours upon any one thing, seems to be that eternal
love, which is recommended by all the sacred books of the East and the
West; because as soon as we begin to love one thing or one being more
than another, we not only detract from the rest an amount of love which
the rest may rightfully claim; but we also become attached to the object
of our love, a fate against which we are seriously warned in various
pages of these books.</p>

<p class='c028'>The <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite> teaches that we should not love or hate any object
of sense whatsoever, nor be attached to any object or thing, but renounce
all projects and fix our thoughts solely on It, the Eternal, which is
no-thing and no object of cognition for us, but whose presence can be
only subjectively experienced by, and within ourselves. It says: “He
is esteemed, who is equal-minded to companions, friends, enemies,
strangers, neutrals, to aliens and kindred, yea to good and evil men”
(Cap. vi., 14); and further on it says: “He whose soul is united by
devotion, seeing the same in all around, sees the soul in everything and
everything in the soul. He who sees Me (Brahmâ) everywhere and
everything in Me, him I forsake not and he forsakes not me.... He
who sees the same in everything—Arjuna!—whether it be pleasant or
grievous, from the self-resemblance, is deemed to be a most excellent
Yogin” (Cap. vi., 29, 32).</p>

<p class='c028'>On almost every page of the <cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite> we are instructed only to
direct our love to that which is eternal in every form, and let the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>itself be a matter of secondary consideration. “He must be regarded
as a steadfast renouncer, who neither hates nor desires.”... “In a
learned and modest Brahman, in a cow, in an elephant, in a dog, and a
Swapāka; they who have knowledge see the same thing.”... “Let no
man rejoice in attaining what is pleasant, nor grieve in attaining what is
unpleasant; being fixed in mind, untroubled, knowing Brahma and
abiding in Brahma.”... “He who is happy in himself, pleased with
himself, who finds also light in himself, this Yogin, one with Brahmâ,
finds <em>Nirvana</em> in Him.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The great <em>Hermes Trismegistus</em> teaches the same identical doctrine;
for he says: “Rise and embrace me with thy whole being, and I will
teach thee whatsoever thou desirest to know.” The <cite>Bible</cite> also tells us
that “God is Love” (1. John iv., 8), and that we should love Him with
all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind (Math. xxii., 37),
and while it teaches that we should love nothing else but God (Math.
xx., 37), who is All in All (Ephes. i., 23), yet it affirms, that this God is
omnipresent, eternal and incomprehensible to the finite understanding
of mortals (1. Timoth. vi., 16). It teaches this love to be the most
important of all possessions, without which all other possessions are
useless (1. Corinth, xiii., 2), and yet this God, whom we are to love, is
not an “object” (John i., 5), but everywhere. He is in us and we in
Him (Rom. xii., 5). We are to leave all objects of sense and follow
Him alone (Luc. v., 2), although we have no means of intellectually
knowing or perceiving Him, the great Unknown, for whose sake we are
to give up house and brethren, sisters, father, mother, wife, children and
lands (Mark x., 29).</p>

<p class='c028'>What can all this mean, but that love itself is the legitimate object of
love? It is a divine, eternal, and infinite power, a light, which reflects
itself in every object while it seeks not the object, but merely its own
reflection therein. It is an indestructible fire and the brighter it burns,
the stronger will be the light and the clearer will its own image appear.
Love falls in love with nothing but its own self, it is free from all other
attractions. A love which becomes attached to objects of sense, ceases
to be free, ceases to be love, and becomes mere desire. Pure and eternal
love asks for nothing, but gives freely to all who are willing to take.
Earthly love is attracted to persons and things, but Divine spiritual love
seeks only that which is divine in everything, and this can be nothing
else but love, for love is the supreme power of all. It holds together
the worlds in space, it clothes the earth in bright and beautiful colours,
it guides the instincts of animals and links together the hearts of human
beings. Acting upon the lower planes of existence it causes terrestrial
things to cling to each other with fond embrace; but love on the spiritual
plane is free. Spiritual love is a goddess, who continually sacrifices
herself for herself and who accepts no other sacrifice but her own self,
giving for whatever she may receive, herself in return. Therefore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span><cite>Bhagavad Gita</cite> says: “Nourish ye the gods by this and let the gods
nourish you. Thus nourishing each other ye shall obtain the highest
good” (Cap. iii., ii.,); and the Bible says: “To him who has still more
shall be given, and from him who has not, even what he has shall be
taken away” (Luke xix., 26).</p>

<p class='c028'>Love is an universal power and therefore immortal, it can never die.
We cannot believe that even the smallest particle of love ever died, only
the instruments through which it becomes manifest change their form;
nor will it ever be born, for it exists from eternity, only the bodies into
which it shines are born and die and are born again. A Love which is
not manifest is non-existent for us, to come into existence means to
become manifest. How then could we possibly imagine a human being
possessed of a love which never becomes manifest; how can we possibly
conceive of a light which never shines and of a fire which does not give
any heat?</p>

<p class='c028'>But “as the sun shines upon the lands of the just and the unjust, and
as the rain descends upon the acres of the evil-minded as well as upon
those of the good”; likewise divine love manifesting itself in a perfect
man is distributed alike to every one without favour or partiality.
Wherever a good and perfect human being exists, there is divine love
manifest; and the degree of man’s perfection will depend on the degree
of his capacity to serve as an instrument for the manifestation of divine
love. The more perfect he is, the more will his love descend upon and
penetrate all who come within his divine influence. To ask favours of
God is to conceive of Him as an imperfect being, whose love is not free,
but subject to the guidance of, and preference to, mortals. To expect
favours of a Mahatma is to conceive him as an <em>imperfect</em> man.</p>

<p class='c028'>True, “prayer,” <i>i.e.</i> the elevation and aspiration of the soul “in spirit
and in truth” (John xiv., 14), is useful, not because it will persuade the
light to come nearer to us, but because it will assist us to open our eyes
for the purpose of seeing the light that was already there. Let those
who desire to come into contact with the Adepts enter their sphere by
following their doctrines; seeking for love, but not for an object of love,
and when they have found the former, they will find a superabundance
of the latter throughout the whole extent of the unlimited universe;
they will find it in everything that exists, for love is the foundation
of all existence and without love nothing can possibly continue
to exist.</p>

<p class='c028'>Love—divine love—is the source of life, of light, and happiness. It is
the creative principle in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosm of man.
It is <em>Venus</em>, the mother of all the gods, because from her alone originates
Will and Imagination and all the other powers by which the
universe was evolved. It is the germ of divinity which exists in the
heart of man, and which may develop into a life-giving sun, illuminating
the mind and sending its rays to the centre of the universe; for it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>originates from that centre and to that centre it will ultimately return.
It is a divine messenger, who carries Light from Heaven down to the
Earth and returns again to Heaven loaded with sacrificial gifts.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is worshipped by all, some adore it in one form and some in
another, but many perceive only the form and do not perceive the divine
spirit. Nevertheless the spirit alone is real, the form is an illusion.
Love can exist without form, but no form can exist without love. It is
pure Spirit, but if its light is reflected in matter, it creates desire and
desire is the producer of forms. Thus the visible world of perishable
things is created. “But above this visible nature there exists another,
unseen and eternal, which, when all created things perish, does not
perish” (Bh. G. viii. 20), and “from which they who attain to it never
return.” This is the supreme abode of Love without any object, unmanifested
and imperishable, for there no object exists. There love is
united to love, enjoying supreme and eternal happiness within her own
self and that peace, of which the mortal mind, captivated by the illusion
of form, cannot conceive. Non-existent for us, and yet existing in that
Supreme <em>Be-ness</em>, in which all things dwell, by which the universe
has been spread out, and which may be attained to by an exclusive
devotion.</p>

<div class='nf-center c034'>
    <div>A MODERN MAGICIAN. <span class='sc'>A Romance</span>, by J. Fitzgerald Molloy, in Three Volumes. Ward &amp; Downey, 12, York Street, Covent Garden.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>Opinions may be greatly divided as to the merits of this book; and to those
who look for unexceptionable literary style as a primary element in fiction, it
may not be satisfactory. But to all those who regard ideas as the first requisite,
this work will probably prove of great interest. It has been somewhat curious
to note the reception with which Mr. Molloy has met. The <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>,
for instance, devotes considerable length to him, and somewhat smartly calls him
“a novelist born, but not made”; after which it proceeds, with more apparent
animus than judiciousness, to criticise the pedantic style of conversation and narrative
which the author occasionally makes use of. Curiously enough, the critic
selects for his worst blows the phrases used by the chief inspector of the detectives.
Now, if there is one thing more common than another, it is to find the half educated,
but uncultured, men of the class from which police inspectors are drawn,
using the longest words and phrases, not so much as a proof of their culture, as
with the object of impressing their hearers. The reviewer was perhaps right
to assail Mr. Molloy for sending his hero to Scotland Yard to hunt up news of
his erring wife, who, as he was perfectly aware, had fled with another man. But
this, and other trifling mistakes of similar character, are venial errors, and could
only be so strongly animadverted upon in a paper which devotes itself to hunting
plagiarisms in impossible places, through envy of successful authors; or by a
reviewer who is a personal enemy of the author. As Macintosh well said:
“The critic who is discerning in nothing but faults, may care little to be told that
this is the mark of unenviable disposition, but he might not feel equally easy,
were he convinced that he thus gives absolute proofs of ignorance and want of
taste.” To make matters worse, and more interesting to <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, the reviewer
is plainly a partisan of the Society for Psychical Research, to which Mr. Molloy
somewhat unfeelingly alludes as the “Society of Scientific Cackle.” The review
in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> starts with smartness and intelligence, but allows itself
to run off into partisanship and prejudice. But all that is in strict keeping
with the tone of a “Gazette” which generally starts useful work well, continues it
badly, and ends by throwing mud out of the gutter at anybody or anything
which happens to run counter to it. For instance, here is a specimen of the
reviewer:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“As a story teller he (the author) is the Bobadil of fashionable mysticism: as a literary workman he
is a pretentious bungler: his syntax is inconceivable, his dialogue impossible, his style a desperately
careful expression of desperately slovenly thinking, his notions of practical affairs absurd, and his conception
of science and philosophy a superstitious guess; yet he has an indescribable flourish, a dash of
half-ridiculous poetry, a pathetic irresponsibility, a captivating gleam of Irish imagination, and, above
all, an unsuspicious good nature, that compel a humane public to read his books rather than mortify
him by a neglect which he has done nothing malicious to deserve.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Such criticism can only be met from the point of view of the reviewer, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>“Set a thief to catch a thief,” and from that of Mr. Molloy, by “Heaven save
me from the penny-a-liners, actuated by personal animus!”</p>

<p class='c028'>The reviewer may be allowed to have pointed out a few glaring errors in Mr.
Molloy’s style and syntax, but we add that, in pointing these out, he has only
exposed himself.</p>

<p class='c028'>As regards the central figure of Benoni, the adept in the book, <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> may,
perhaps, say a few words. Slightly as the character is drawn, and startling as
are the deeds of this personage, there is a majesty about him which commands
respect, and we may congratulate Mr. Molloy on his effort. We do not entirely
accord with the author in the deeds which he sets Benoni to do, but with regard
to the words and precepts which he puts into the adept’s mouth, we do absolutely
agree, and recommend our readers, and especially all the Theosophists, to
read Mr. Molloy’s book. Here the <cite>Pall Mall</cite> reviewer—being, as said, an
admiring follower of the Society for Psychical Research—again falls foul of Mr.
Molloy; but we may safely quote the impressive and truthful words of Benoni,
and leave the rest to others.</p>

<p class='c028'>Amerton, the hero of the book, reproaches the adept with having seen
trouble approaching him, and with having neglected to warn him. Benoni replies:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“That is true. It was not permitted that I should serve you then; to test your strength it was necessary
that you should bear the trial unaided. When, some years ago. you came to me in Africa, and
asked me to solve experiences which perplexed you, and later besought Amuni, the faithful One, to show
you the pathway leading towards light, you but obeyed a dictate of your nature impossible to resist.
That within you urged you forward to seek the sacred mysteries of life and death. But these cannot be
obtained by those who are not prepared to endure with patience, and grow strong in spirit. You have
suffered, and thus taken the first step towards the attainment of your desires.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“But, surely,” said Philip, “you might have warned me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I should have but inflicted additional pain on you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Was there no escape?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“None, indeed,” replied the mystic.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Then I was destined to meet humiliation and pain.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Benoni looked at him with mingled pity and affection in his gaze.</p>

<p class='c028'>“A child,” he said, in his low, sonorous voice, “is grieved for a broken toy, or is humiliated by correction.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“But you don’t compare my wrongs to a child’s grievances?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“His sorrows are as real and bitter to him as your afflictions are to you. It is only when time has
passed, he reviews his distress with wonder, seeing the pettiness of its cause. So will it be with you. Ten
years hence, you will regard this grief, desolating your life, with equanimity; forty years later, you will
remember it with indifference, as an item in your fate. Then shall you look back upon the brightness
and darkness of your existence as one regards the lights and shadows chequering his pathway through
woods in spring. How futile seem woe and joy, weighed with the consideration that all men are as
shadows that fade, and as vapours which flee away.... Think, my friend,” continued the
mystic earnestly, “of your existence but as a journey towards a goal, on which hardships must be
suffered by the way. You are now but working out the fulfillment of your fate. Remember, those
who would ascend must suffer; affliction is the flame which purifies; pain teaches compassion.” (pp.
89, 90. Vol. III.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>When asked of himself, Benoni replies:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Misfortune cannot compass, distress overwhelm, nor disappointments assail me, because the
things of the world are as naught to my senses, and man’s life seems but a dream. Before this stage
affliction must have crucified the senses; self must be conquered, slain, and entombed.” (p. 91, Vol.
III.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>There are other passages equally true from the occult standpoint, and we
trust their readers will benefit by them and appreciate them.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>As regards Amerton’s character, we see the natural, born, mystic turning aside
and voluntarily taking upon himself, though warned, the bonds of married life.
These become intolerable to him, and the unhappiness of two persons results.
Occultism is a jealous mistress, and, once launched on that path, it is necessary
to resolutely refuse to recognise any attempt to draw one back from it.
Amerton wanted to crush out his natural tendencies to occultism, and failed.
It is as hard to draw back from them, and turn attention solely to the things of
the world, as it is, when studying occultism, to turn our attention solely to the
invisible regions, and neglect absolutely the physical world.</p>

<p class='c028'>The other characters in the novel make it light, graceful and pleasant reading.
The interest is ever preserved from the first to the last scene, and certainly
no one could find, in all the three volumes, one dull page in them. Moreover,
Mr. Fitzgerald Molloy seems an acute observer. Some of his secondary
heroes, such as the wealthy widow, Mrs. Henry Netley, a plebeian enamoured of
rank and title, and Lord Pompey Rokeway, “a gay, though ancient, personage,”
who uses rouge, wig, and corsets, and imagines every woman in love with him—are
portraits from nature, to one who knows anything of modern society. In
short, “The Modern Magician,” as a work of fiction, can fearlessly bear comparison
with any of the modern productions written lately upon occult subjects,
with the solitary exception of Rider Haggard’s “She,” and surpasses some in
unabated interest. We might be more exacting and severe, perhaps, were it a
purely theosophical work. As it stands, however, we must congratulate Mr.
Molloy in having clothed the subject of mysticism in such graceful robes; had
he been as good a literary workman as he is an excellent constructor of plots, the
book should have met with unqualified approval. Meanwhile, we wish it the
greatest success.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c054'>“THE TWIN SOUL: <span class='sc'>a Psychological and Realistic Romance</span>,” in two
volumes, by an Anonymous Author. Ward &amp; Downey, 12, York Street,
Covent Garden.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is quite another kind of literary production than the “Modern
Magician,” just reviewed. It aspires to more serious and philosophical
mysticism, but fails rather ungloriously. There are passages in it which, taken
out of the work, especially at the beginning of Volume I., might be made the
subjects of short and rather useful little treatises upon mystic theories; but, as a
whole, the book is one of the most disappointing novels published for some time. It
begins well, goes on from bad to worse, promises much, holds nothing, and ends
nowhere, seeming to be written not as a work of fiction, but simply to ventilate
the author’s ideas. These—the work being anonymous—have to be judged by
the novel alone. It is rumoured that the “Twin Soul” is the occasional work
of twelve years’ labour, and the disconnected character of its events bears out
the rumour. Its style is pedantic, though good in writing, while the matter and
plot are heavy, and delivered in a long-winded and didactic manner.</p>

<p class='c028'>The story is that of one Mr. Rameses, an exceedingly virtuous, learned, and
solemn Oriental millionaire, whose real nationality remains to the end a mystery,
and whose story is narrated by a somewhat cynical English philosopher, called
De Vere. The latter tells the story in the style which suits him best, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>perfectly natural. He is humorous and amusing, even if slightly ponderous.
But alas for the reader! Mr. De Vere suddenly stops short at an early stage,
and the story is taken up, without any apparent cause or reason, by a man
unknown, who “had less sympathy with Mr. Rameses,” and who has all the
defects of Mr. De Vere’s qualities, and a good many of his own besides, for he
is even more ponderous and more cynical, without his humour. Mr. Rameses
is a peculiar character, but, as sketched, he is quite in keeping with his Oriental
origin. He believes in many theories: re-incarnation, socialism, certain occult
doctrines, the possibility of recovering the memory of past incarnations, and, as a
matter of course, the modern craze of the day, the theory of “twin souls.” He
is perpetually in search of his “twin,” and hunts her with the pertinacity of a
sleuth-hound under all forms, and in all places. Mr. De Vere is the possessor
of an Assyrian collection, Egyptian papyri, and also of two female mummies—Amenophra
and Lurulâ, the first the daughter of a Pharaoh, the second a priestess
of Isis—of which the sarcophagi are covered with hieroglyphics, which Mr. Rameses
reads with most surprising ease. The hero, claiming his memory as a palimpsest,
which by certain processes clearly discovers the obliterated record of his past
incarnations, cannot, in spite of this, make up his mind which of the two mummies
was formerly the body of his twin-soul. Finally, he solves the doubt by declaring
them both to have been the mortal casket of his beloved—with Lurulâ  for
choice. The reader here has great hopes held out to him that there will be a
grand ceremony, at which the mummies are to be unrolled, and at which the
soul of the deceased mummy will be summoned back to shuffle on a mortal coil
again. Alas! such hopes are fallacious; for the ceremony never takes place,
owing to Mr. Rameses falling in love with the sister of a Hindu lady married to
an English baronet. After much hesitation the lady so honoured by his choice
is also declared to be the vehicle of his twin-soul, <i>i.e.</i>, to save appearances—to
be a re-incarnation of the ego which formerly dwelt in the mummy or mummies.
Finally, after a long-winded oration over the mystic properties of a magnificent
present of jewels, Mr. Rameses wins “the fair Niona,” as she is called—who,
although a Hindu, is a Zoroastrian Sun-worshipper. They are married, notwithstanding
their “paganism,” according to Roman Catholic rites, and the pair
start to spend the honeymoon in Egypt, where, in the Temple of Isis at Thebes,
they are to be again united according to the—to them—more sacred ritual of Sun-worship.
After a very interesting dream about the Deluge, which broke through
an isthmus uniting Gibraltar to North Africa, and destroyed a vast civilization
which occupied the floor of the present Mediterranean Sea, they arrive safely in
Egypt. Here the fair Hindu of Zoroastrian persuasion and Italian name, has
another interesting psychic vision, an interview with the Sphinx, which makes her
incontinently faint, and lose consciousness. Then they proceed to Thebes, and,
after due care, make selection of the site of the Temple of Isis. They build
their bonfire and ignite it, but at the supreme moment Niona gives a gasp, faints,
and this time dies outright, with as little reason for it as every other incident in
the novel has. The return to Cairo is immediately commenced, and here Niona,
in strict keeping with Mr. Rameses’s habits, is at once converted into a mummy.
It must be rather interesting to possess the body of three defunct twin souls,
and reflect upon their virtues.</p>

<p class='c028'>The rest of the book is occupied by various disquisitions of the author,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>disguised flimsily under conversations of his characters on the social and
political customs of the Nineteenth century. Read carefully, the conversations
contain ideas, but are likely to offend on account of their length and ponderousness.
As regards the construction of the book and the characters, Mr. Rameses
is interesting, in spite of his solemnity and his love of mummies, and Mr. De Vere
is amusing. The other <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>dramatis personæ</i></span> seem to have been created merely as
pegs upon which to hang the author’s opinions. What, for instance, is the
object of entering into detail upon the passionate episodes in the career of Mr.
Rameses’s secretary, or the mercenary marriage of Lady Gwendoline Pierrepoint
with “Old Methusaleh”? Their only excuse can be that they may serve
to increase the contrast between such marriages and that with a twin soul.
Taken as a whole, the ideas are interesting, and the mystic utterances in the
first volume almost correct from the orthodox occult point. But the manner in
which they are displayed is irritating, and this chiefly because the reader is
perpetually being brought up to a point of interest, and as perpetually left
disappointed.</p>

<h4 class='c055'>POSTHUMOUS HUMANITY.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c013'><sup>[129]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c035'>This is a translation from the French by Colonel H. S. Olcott, President of
the Theosophical Society, of the remarkable work of that name, by a well-known
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>savant</i></span>, Adolphe d’Assier. The original work appeared a few years ago, and produced
a stir both in the sceptical public and unbelieving science, and an outcry
among the spiritists of France, whose pet theories about the “spirits” of the dead
it upset. “Posthumous Humanity” was not only a singularly interesting work,
but it was one of the first, and perhaps the loudest, of the bugle notes that
heralded the last act of the fierce battle between materialistic science and spiritualism;
for it ended in the virtual defeat of the former, at any rate, upon one
line: it forced the hand of the majority of sceptics in the recognition of what is
called in mysticism the “astral body” of man and animal, and by more pretentious
than wise investigators “the <em>phantasms</em> of the living,” forgetting those of
the dead.</p>

<p class='c028'>That a learned member of an academy of science should, of all men, write a
serious book on the phenomena of “the Borderland,” accepting as facts in nature
such things as ghostly appearances, and the projection of the double, is
almost a phenomenon in itself. And what makes the case the more remarkable
as an indication of a new current in public opinion, is the fact that these things,
which it has hitherto been the fashion to consign with a laugh or a shudder to
the limbo of exploded superstitions, are treated by the author in a perfectly
scientific spirit. He accounts for them, not by the usual supposition of hallucination
or stupidity on the part of observers, but by an exceedingly ingenious
and plausible postulation of forces at work in us, and around us, which are as
little “supernatural” as any of the recognised forces of nature, or portions of
man’s constitution. Not only has M. d’Assier the courage to face the probable
ridicule of the wiseacres, but he has the audacity to turn the tables upon “men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>science,” by actually making fun of their unmeasured pretensions, and twitting
them mercilessly about their past mistakes. Not the least remarkable feature
in the case is the fact that the author, who started into these researches an ardent
positivist, has come out of them an ardent positivist still. He believes that
what he has accomplished is to extend the reign of matter into a region previously
believed to belong to spirit, thus planting the standard of positivism in a
wider and more fruitful region, which he has happily reclaimed from the winds
and tides of superstition. But the fact is, that although our author has gone a
good deal further than most of those who start out “on their own hook” to explore
the realms of the Occult, he cannot be said to have penetrated very far into
the mysteries of being. He has peeped in at the door of the psychic antechamber
to the spiritual world proper—the ante-chamber in which the members
of Psychical Research Societies amuse themselves and others by playing blindman’s
buff with hypothesis—and his interesting volume tells us of the wonderful
things that go on there. The result of his researches, as he says in his <cite>Preface</cite>,
is the conclusion that “posthumous humanity is, in fact, but a special example of
posthumous animality, and that the latter presents itself as the immediate consequence
of the living world.” Every tyro in theosophy knows that this conclusion
is a fair approximation to the truth, and were man nothing but an animal of high
degree, it might possibly be the whole truth. But man is an animal, plus <em>something</em>,
and this something <em>more</em>, is precisely what M. d’Assier leaves entirely out
of sight, as indeed he could hardly help doing if he attached any importance to
remaining a Positivist. It is this <em>something more</em>, of whose very existence our
author seems profoundly unconscious, that has the chief interest for us, for that
is the spiritual and eternal part of man, in contradistinction to the psychic portion
which fades away and disappears after a time, as M. d’Assier very justly
declares.</p>

<p class='c028'>It seems a pity that a learned and ingenious man, like our author, should not have
begun investigations of this kind by making himself familiar with at least the bare
outline of the metaphysical and psychological system that underlies the schools of
philosophy of India. This system is the result of very profound research into such
phenomena as our author deals with, and also into other far deeper and more
important manifestations that he has not considered at all; and these researches
have for thousands of years occupied, to a greater or lesser degree, almost every
thinking man among races which are acknowledged to be possessed of a very
high degree of intellectual acuteness and spiritual insight. Were our Western
adventurers into the borderland between spirit and matter—the astral world—to
take this obvious precaution, they would know that the ground over which
they now laboriously make their way, has not only been traversed before, but
pretty fully surveyed and mapped out, and that their supposed discoveries
amount virtually to no more than a verification of results long ago obtained by
others. This very needed exception in the work under review has been obviated
by the translator’s notes and supplement, without diminishing the practical
value of M. d’Assier’s treatise as a useful contribution to occult literature. For, as
his labours do actually confirm much of the teachings of Theosophy, with regard to
that part of the constitution of man, which is common to him and the animals,
the work, as it now stands, is really a valuable occult treatise as to facts. The
important question with the world, in these times, being not so much <em>what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>said</em>, as <em>who it is that says it</em>, the fact that an incorrigible positivist, has published
his belief in the actuality of a psychic plane of existence, and of the temporary
survival in it after death of a certain part or principle of the animal
(including man), is of the greatest help and importance to theosophy. It will
probably affect public opinion far more profoundly than if a thousand Eastern
sages proclaimed the same elementary fact of Occultism in chorus. No better
illustration of, and testimony to, the reality of plain, broad facts in connection
with wraiths, “doubles,” and other such apparitions, can be found than in d’Assier’s
“Posthumous Humanity” in its new English garb, by Colonel Olcott, and with
the translator’s <cite>Preface</cite> and annotations to the text. These add greatly to the
value of the book for the student of Occultism. In fact, these additions serve the
same purpose which a notice of the work in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> might have been expected
to have in view; for they correct the author in some particulars, add additional
information in others, and generally forestall the critic who writes from the
Theosophical standpoint. Besides this, the translator has added a highly interesting
and unique <em>appendix</em>, giving the opinions of numerous Hindus of various
castes and sects upon psychic phenomena of that kind, collected from various
parts of India, which, by itself, has considerable value to the student of mystical
sciences. In conclusion, we may record almost a general opinion—save, of
course, that of rank materialists—that no work yet published on the subject
dealt with by our author is better calculated to reach the scientifically-minded enquirer.
It is written with calmness and logical clearness that takes the scoffer’s
laugh out of his mouth. It goes as far as anyone new to the subject could be
reasonably expected to follow; and the direction it takes is the right one. It is
preeminently <em>the</em> book for the too sceptical and ignorant enquirer to begin
with.</p>

<p class='c028'>ספר יצירה, <cite>Sepher Yetzirah, The Book of Formation, and
the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom</cite>; <cite>translated from the Hebrew,
and collated with Latin Versions. By Dr. W. Wynn Westcott,
Bath: Robert H. Fryar</cite>, 1887.</p>

<p class='c028'>This is a treatise of about 30 quarto pages on that well-known Hebrew occult
work, the Sepher Yetzirah. It consists of an introduction, giving the historic
aspects of the matter, an English translation of the Sepher Yetzirah and the
Thirty-two Paths, and several pages of notes, giving remarks on and variant
readings of difficult and disputed passages.</p>

<p class='c028'>The introductory pages bear the stamp of considerable literary research, and
the translation of the Book of Formation itself is intelligible and concise. But
we can hardly say as much for the Thirty-two Paths, which, abstruse and difficult
of comprehension in the original, are, we are afraid, no more intelligible in the
translation. Owing to the unpopularity of the subject, there are readers who
will be readily drawing the conclusion that Dr. Westcott himself does not altogether
understand their mystical bearing and symbolism. Yet the notes on the
actual text of the “Sepher Yetzirah” are valuable, and show considerable
occult knowledge. But a still greater error is made by the translator. We
notice that Dr. Westcott has invariably rendered the word Elohim by “God,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>notwithstanding that it is a plural noun, as shown by the plural word
“Chiim” joined thereto in the ninth section of the first chapter. This will, no
doubt, prove grateful to the staff and readers of the <cite>Jewish World</cite>, whose editors
pride themselves, against all fact and truth, on the <em>Monotheism</em> of their early
ancestors. It cannot fail to strike the Kabalists as an unfortunate deviation
from the original meaning in favour of one laboriously fabricated by both Jewish
and Christian falsificators.</p>

<p class='c028'>The “Book of Formation” is a treatise consisting of 6 chapters and 33
sections, and thus its compilation is pentacular. The 6 chapters refer to the
Yetziratic World, the 6 periods of Genesis; while the 33 sections have a close
analogy with the Thirty-two Paths which are added at the end of the work. It is
a philosophical disquisition on the occult meanings of the ten numbers of the
decimal scale, and the 22 letters of the Hebrew sacred alphabet. The first
chapter deals with the numbers, which it divides into a Tetrad (symbolising
Spirit, Air, Water, and Fire), and a Hexad (symbolising Height, Depth, East,
West, South and North). The second chapter treats generally of the 22 letters,
produced from the Air or the number 2, and divided into 3 Mother-letters, 7
double-letters, and 12 simple letters. The third chapter shows the symbolic
reference of the 3 Mother-letters to Air, Water, and Fire; the fourth chapter
that of the 7 double-letters to the Planets &amp;c.; the fifth chapter that of the 12
simple letters to the signs of the Zodiac, &amp;c.; and the sixth chapter forms the
synthesis.</p>

<p class='c028'>The 32 paths are no other than symbolical developments of the 10 Sephiroth
or numbers, and the 22 letters which form the connecting links between them.</p>

<p class='c028'>Altogether the work is interesting and worthy of careful study.</p>

The octave is spanned by treble or threefold chords, but Miss Furley has not

poem of the <cite>Other Isolt</cite>, are assuredly good enough to interest and delight a
sufficient number of women to send it into a second edition. The writer has a
distinct faculty of seeing, as well as the tendency to take the “other side,” as

<h3 class='c018'>THE CREATOR, AND WHAT WE MAY KNOW OF THE METHOD OF CREATION.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c013'><sup>[130]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c035'>The above is the title of a lecture, forming the seventeenth of what are known
as the “Fernley Lectures,” delivered annually, by the leading minds in the
Ministry of the Wesleyan Methodist Society. This specific lecture is the latest
of the series, and was delivered in Manchester, August 1st in present year, by
the Rev. W. H. Dallinger, LL.D., F.R.S., Pres. R.M.S., etc., Governor of
Wesley College, Sheffield.</p>

<p class='c028'>The lecture occupies an unique position amongst its fellows, and will bear
a most favourable comparison with any that have been delivered by the various
Presidents of the Royal Society on the sciences of the day. For clearness of
argument and lucidity of thought—<em>as far as it goes</em>—it is unsurpassed, and, as a
specimen of the power of English language, it is a treat to all who can estimate its
value. It is all this, and more, and here its significance and suggestiveness comes
in, and I can do no less than characterise its delivery under the circumstances, to
an auditory that represents (in the eyes of the sect itself, at all events) the purest
form of Evangelical religion, as a startling phenomenon, and as such I consider
a notice of it in no way out of place in a theosophical journal. That such a
lecture should be allowed to be delivered and favourably received, not only by
the audience, but by the Wesleyan body at large, is a “sign of the times” that
the intelligent observer cannot fail to discern. It is, undoubtedly, an index
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>finger that marks a large advance in the progress of human emancipation from
the increasingly intolerable yoke of Churchianic or Ecclesiastical tyranny; and
all “friends of progress” will cheerfully render to the worthy and eloquent
lecturer the thanks that are due for his manly and outspoken views upon the
profoundest question of the age. The strangest part is the spectacle of a
“Minister of the Gospel,” himself a scientist of no mean order, proclaiming
from a Methodist platform his adherence to, and acceptance of, the doctrines of
Charles Darwin, as true exponents of the “Method of Creation,” which means
that “Natural Selection,” and survival of the “Fittest,” accounts for the origin
of species and the indefinite variety of extinct and extant animal forms of life.
Why not include vegetable forms <a id='corr404.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='s'>as</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_404.11'><ins class='correction' title='s'>as</ins></a></span> well? Methinks the fabulous “missing
link” between the vegetable and animal kingdoms may, without much difficulty,
be actually spotted. Nature, as delineated by the great “Naturalist,” must
have been very peevish and unkind to her worshippers, when she mocks them
by destroying every vestige, even to the veriest fragmentary fossil, of this anxiously
looked for and expectant missing link, between the animal (brute)
and man! To my view, the continuous chain of sequential life forms, as presented
in the Darwinian theory, evinces a vast number of “missing links,” and,
unless these can be supplied, it will not bear the strain when tested by the unclouded
intellect of man. The philosopher of Materialism may accept the
Darwinian theories (for as yet they are nothing less or more) as gospel, but the
spiritual philosopher will not, nor can he accept them as truth, simply because
he recognises a factor, which is an abomination in the eyes of the materialistic
“wise ones.” It is this factor that the eloquent and learned lecturer pleads
for, without suspecting what it really is. I have reason to know that our reverend
scientist regards this “Spiritual” factor with the utmost contempt. But
I leave this, and pass on to notice some of the really valuable thoughts and facts
that ennoble the lecture, which is addressed to “thoughtful and earnest
minds, not concerned specially with questions of philosophy, metaphysics, and
science, but alive to the advanced knowledge and thought of our times, and
anxious to know how the great foundation of religious belief, the existence of
Deity, is affected by the splendid advance of our knowledge of nature.”</p>

<p class='c028'>This expression “existence of Deity” is conveniently elastic enough to cover
the ground of argument by a scientific theologian, inasmuch as it may be taken
to mean a personal God, according to sound Evangelical belief, and thus assume
a plausible defence of Theism versus Atheism; or, it may admit of a much
wider application to an “Unknown God”; for when the lecturer does venture to
delineate the characteristic of Deity as the Creator, it is such terms as “Inscrutable
Power or Creator,” “Eternal Mind,” “Infinite Intelligence,” &amp;c., which is
tantamount to saying that the Primal Cause of all that is, is unknowable; and
if this is what Dr. Dallinger really means, he is at one with the Spiritual
Philosopher; but this will be a curious weapon in the hands of an ecclesiastical
theologian—as dangerous as it is curious. By the use of these terms the
reverend author shields himself from the charge of materialistic heresy, albeit to
the clear-sighted one there are several, if not many, weak and vulnerable points
in the defensive armour; but if the adherents and votaries of the “faith once
delivered to the saints” might be a little chary in their acceptance of him as a
“sound” exponent of religious truth, yet all progressive minds will hail him as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>a fearless champion for the truth as delivered by the Book of Nature and
interpreted by the splendid achievements of modern science.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The study of phenomena, their succession and their classification, is the essential work of science.
It has no function, and is possessed of no instrument with which to look behind or below the sequence,
in quest of some higher relation. The eye and mind of the experimentalist know only of antecedent
and consequent. These fill the whole circle of his research; let him find these, and he has
found all.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Here the domain of “science” is defined by a master mind, which tells us
that “the researches of science are physical.” The observable, finite contents
of space and time are the subjects of its analysis. Existence, not the cause of
existence, succession, not the reason of succession, method, not the origin of
method, are the subjects of physical research. A primordial cause cannot be
the subject of experiment nor the object of demonstration. It must for ever
transcend the most delicate physical re-action, the profoundest analysis, and the
last link in the keenest logic. Science refuses absolutely to recognise mind as
the primal cause of the sequences of matter. This is just—within the strict
region of its research—for phenomena, their sequences and classification, are its
sole domain. But observe; science universally puts <em>force</em> where the reason
asks for cause. The forces affecting matter are tacitly assumed to be competent
to account for every activity, every sequence, every phenomenon, and all the
harmonies of universal being, a nexus for the infinite diversities and harmonies,
a basis for all the equilibrium of nature, is found by modern science in force.
But force is as absolutely inscrutable as mind. Force can never be known in
itself; it is known by its manifestations. It is not a phenomenon, it produces
phenomena. We cannot know it; but we know nothing without it. The
ultimate analysis of physical science is the relations of matter and force. In
irreducible terms, therefore, the final analysis of science is <em>matter as affected by
motion</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>We now see, from the above excerpta, the goal to which the “splendid
discoveries” of modern science lead its votaries, as portrayed by an authority
that claims to speak not as other men; and if it is not a veritable dismal
swamp, leading to nothing or negation; a miasma suffocating the aspirations of
those who are trusting to the leadership of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>savants</i></span> to guide them in the path
that conveys them to the habitat of true wisdom and knowledge of themselves;
then I can only say of such, “miserable comforters are ye all.”</p>

<p class='c028'>But the question intervenes here: is this a true definition of the end and
aim of science? It may be to the majority of the Royal Society; but I may
tell those who claim to be the conservators of science, and who arrogate to
themselves the right to define the boundaries of even physical science, that they
do not possess the <em>all</em> of human intelligence, and that there are, outside their
societies, men who refuse to bow the knee to the modern scientific Baal, who
refuse to be cajoled by the use of terms that mystify but certainly do not
enlighten. For instance, who is one wit the wiser when, having reached the
end of its tether, science discovers that “matter and motion” govern and
regulate all things observable by the human eye, or within the range of the
human mind? To the credit of the author of the last Fernley Lecture, he
sees and acknowledges the dilemma into which “materialistic” science is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>driven; but whether “theological” science, so ably represented by himself, can
altogether evade it, is a question that I do not here stay to propound. This
much, however, I may say, scientific dicta notwithstanding, there is another
department of scientific research which <em>does</em> form the <em>nexus</em>—the <em>veritable</em>
missing link—between the known and their unknown, and this is the science of
psychology, which commences just where the professors of science (physical)
confess themselves baffled, and are unable, or rather unwilling, to advance
further in this to them <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span>. The wilful ignoring of this by
Materialistic leaders of thought ends by putting them out of court in the
discussion of the profound problems arising out of the discoveries of the
psychological scientist. In presence of facts, the evidence for which are world
wide and as demonstrable—<em>on their own plane or ground</em>—as geological, or
astronomical facts which the psychologist adduces, of what conceivable use are
the “relations of matter and force” of the physicist, as explanatory of the
laws, &amp;c., pertaining to the new world discovered by psychological <em>Savants</em>?</p>

<p class='c028'>It will be new to many of your readers to find the Rev. Dr. “hob-nobbing”
with Professor Huxley, who is quoted as—<em>not</em> a Materialist! The learned
professor appears to be indignant with those who are zealous for “the fundamental
article of the faith materialistic,” who “parade force and matter as the
Alpha and Omega of existence,” and says, “If I were forced to choose between
Materialism and Idealism, I would elect for the latter”; and the lecturer adds,
“Truly, if our choice must be between them, this is the normal alternative.” It
were better had the Professor given some inkling as to what <em>he</em> meant by this
high-sounding term “Idealism.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c013'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>The author again says—“I adopt gladly the language of Professor Huxley:
Belief, in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious matter, and needs,
strong foundations. If it were given me to look beyond the abyss of geologically
recorded time to the still more remote period when the earth was passing
through physical and chemical conditions, I should expect to be a witness of
the evolution of living protoplasm from <a id='corr406.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='not—living matter.’'>not-living matter.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_406.30'><ins class='correction' title='not—living matter.’'>not-living matter.</ins></a></span>”</p>

<p class='c028'>“So should I,” adds the Rev. Dr., who brings in Mr. Crooks (?), of whom
the lecturer says, “I do not forget the recent and splendid service done by
Mr. Crooks to the philosophical side of chemistry. It is a most subtle and
exquisite means of endeavouring to deduce the <em>method</em>, the ‘<em>law</em>’ according to
which what we know as the ‘chemical elements’ were built up. He obtains
indications of a primitive element—a something out of which the elements
were evolved. He calls it <em>protyle</em> or first stuff, and from its presence concludes
that the elements, as we know them, have been evolved from simpler matter—or
perhaps, indeed, from one sole kind of matter.” In the following sentences
he tries hard to depreciate this “splendid discovery” by Mr. Crooks, the reason
for which is anything but difficult to discover. Dr. Dallinger <em>knows</em> that Mr.
Crooks published a work entitled “Researches in the Phenomena of
Spiritualism,” containing his <em>Experimental</em> Investigations in Psychic Force,
which he, in conjunction with his friend Huxley, thinks it beneath him to
notice.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>But <em>I</em> claim the “splendid discovery” of Mr. Crooks to be of far more transcendent
importance than the learned scientist will admit. It comes marvellously
near to the scientific demonstration of the ethic propounded by the “philosophy
of spirit,” “There is but one life, and one substance, by which life is manifested
in an infinitude of forms in all universes, from the simplest to the most complex
organic.”</p>

<p class='c028'>On this subject the Lecture contains the following eloquent, and, I may add,
brilliant peroration.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Life, it is well known, has its phenomena inherent in, and strictly confined to, a highly complex
compound, with fixed chemical constituents. This compound, in its living state, is known as protoplasm.
It is clear, colourless, and to our finest optical resources, devoid of discoverable structure.
There is not a living thing on earth but possesses its life in protoplasm, from a microscopic fungus, to
Man. To depict the properties of Life in irreducible simplicity, take one of the lowliest instances
within the range of science. Let it be one of the exquisitely minute, almost infinitely prolific, and
universally diffused living forms that set up, and carry on, putrefaction. The lesser of them may,
when considered as solid specks, vary from the fifty-thousand-millionth of a cubic inch to the twenty-billionth
of a cubic inch (evidently far beneath the unaided optic power of the human eye to see). I
select one that is oval in shape. Its mission as an organism, is to break up and set free the chemical
elements that had been locked up in dead organic compounds. (Query—Was this tiny creature self-generated,
or was it the product of the <em>dead</em> organism?) Its own substance wears out by this and
other means; and it has the power to renovate the waste from the dead decomposition in which it
lives, constructing, in the lavatory of its protoplasm, new living matter. But more; this vital and
inconceivably minute speck multiplies with astounding rapidity in two ways; by the first and common
process, in the course of a minute and a half, the entire body is divided into two precisely similar
bodies, each one perfect; almost immediately these again divide, and so on in geometric ratio through
all the populated fluid; the rapidity of this intense and wonderful vital action transcending all thought.
By this process alone, a single form may, in three hours, give rise to a population of organisms as
great as the human population of the globe. This is life—whether vegetable or animal none can determine—in
the simplest form in which it can be known, and which distinguish it for ever and everywhere
from what is not life.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Several equally interesting examples of recent scientific discoveries are given,
but space forbids me to more than mention them. Science, as represented by
the <em>Savants</em>, evidently believes in an unbridged chasm between the forms of life
and not-life. The Scientist and Philosopher of Spirit join issue on this, for they
declare that “Life is present everywhere, and <em>in</em> all forms, organic or non-organic,
and without the presence of Life no forms—not even mineral—could be
phenomenal or <em>ex</em>istent.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Your space does not permit me to deal with more than one other, and, to
many, the more important subject of Biblical records coming within the domain
of science. Here is a specimen of how the learned scientist and theologian
deals with the biblical account of Creation.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind.’ That is the utterance
of the human conception, which can alone represent to us the divine resolve to fill the earth with life—and
the joy of living things. ‘And it was so.’ But what epochs of countless ages filled the incalculable
interval?”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c013'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The boldness of this utterance from one in the position of the Reverend Lecturer
can be well imagined. It contains the elements of combustion which need
but the spark of investigation to deal a death blow to the established Churchianic
dogma of Biblical infallibility in its literal sense. I conclude by repeating
that such a deliverance by a ministerial representative of the Wesleyan denomination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>is a phenomenon that strikingly indicates the “Signs of the times,” and
which shows that the emancipation of the human mind from the bonds of theological
presumption is not far distant.</p>

<p class='c028'>ABSOLUTE MONISM; OR, MIND IS MATTER AND MATTER
IS MIND. By <span class='sc'>Sundaram Iyer</span>, F.T.S. Madras, 1887.</p>

<p class='c028'>Under the above title the author issues an address delivered at the last
convention of the delegates of the Theosophical Society at Adyar. Metaphysicians,
who note with interest all criticisms of Western psychology
from the Oriental standpoint, will welcome the appearance of this extremely
able and instructive <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>brochure</i></span>, which constitutes the first instalment of
Absolute Monism. The object of the writer is to discuss the point whether an
examination of all theories, as to relations of mind and body, “does not lead us
to the Unistic theory that Mind is Matter, and Matter is Mind.” He endeavours
to merge the apparent dualism of subject and object into a fundamental
unity:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Is mind a product of organized matter? No ... for organized matter is only a combination
of material particles, as is unorganized matter. How is it, then, that there is the manifestation of
Mind in the one case, and not in the other?... Can subjective facts ever emerge out of a group
of molecules? Never; as many times never as there are molecules in the group. And why?
Because Mind cannot issue from No Mind.” (p. 13.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>The line of argument adopted <em>versus</em> Materialism—the doctrine that mental
facts are the <em>resultant</em> of chemical changes in the brain; force and matter being
the only Ultimates of Existence—is unquestionably forcible. Mind can never
be resolved into a “bye-product” of brain activity, for several valid reasons. In
the first place, in its aspect of thought, it exhibits <em>concentration on an end</em>,
<em>intelligence</em> and <em>interest</em> in the subject under consideration, all of which
characteristics, according to Tyndall and Du Bois Reymond, are necessarily
absent from those remarshallings of atoms and molecules which are declared to
“cerebrate out” mental phenomena! In the second place, the gulf between
consciousness and molecular change has never been bridged; an admission to
which the leading physicists and physiologists of the day lend all the weight of
their authority. The terms “consciousness” and “matter” are expressive of
things so utterly contrasted, that all attempts to deduce the former from the
latter have met with signal discredit. Nevertheless, materialists assume the
contrary, whenever the necessities of their philosophy demand it. Hence, we
find men, like Büchner, admitting in one place that “in the relation of soul and
brain, phenomena occur which <em>cannot be explained by ... matter and force</em>,”
and elsewhere resolving mind into the “<em>activity of the tissues of the brain</em>,” “a
mode of motion”—contradictions, the flagrancy of which is enhanced by the
fact that the same author invests the physical automaton Man with a power to
control his actions! Lastly, the degradation of consciousness into “brain-function”
by constituting philosophers, theologians, scientists, and all alike
“conscious automata”—(machines whose thoughts are determined <em>for</em>, not <em>by</em>
their conscious Egos)—knocks away the basis of argument. The only resource
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>becomes universal scepticism; a denial of the possibility of attaining truth.
Can impartiality, correct thinking and agreement, be expected on the part of
controversialists who form part of a comedy of Automata?</p>

<p class='c028'>If mind is not inherent in matter, it cannot be evolved by mere nervous
complexity. The combination of two chemical elements cannot result in a
compound in which something more than the constituent factors are present.
It is sometimes urged that, since the properties of substances are often altogether
changed in the course of chemical combinations—new ones arising with the
temporary lapse of the old—consciousness may be explained as a “peculiar
property” of matter under some of its conditions. Mr. Sundaram Iyer meets
this objection ably. “Aquosity,” it is said, is a property of oxygen and hydrogen
in combination, though not in isolation. To this he answers, “chemical
properties are either purely subjective facts or objectivo-subjective ones” (p. 57).
They exist only in the consciousness of the percipient, and represent no external
and independent reality. Psychologists of the type of Huxley would do well
to recall this fact, apart from the considerations springing from other data.</p>

<p class='c028'>Our author is loud in his praises of <em>Panpsychism</em>, that phase of pantheism
which regards all matter as saturated with a potential psyche. He speaks of
the “catholicity, sublimity and beauty ... not to say the philosophy, and
logic, and truthfulness of this creed of thought.” It is, however, clear that
some of the authorities he cites in support of this view, more especially Clifford,
Tyndall, and Ueberweg, represent a phase of thought which is too materialistic
to do justice to an elevated pantheistic concept. Clifford’s <em>conscious</em> mind-<em>stuff</em>
is sublimated materialism, and Ueberweg speaks of those “sensations” present
in “inanimate” objects which are “concentrated” in the human brain, as if
they represented so many substances to be weighed in scales. Instructive and
thoughtful as is the discussion of this subject (pp. 32-63), its value would have
been increased by a survey of the pantheistic schools of German speculation, so
many of whose conclusions are absolutely at one with esoteric views as to the
Logos and the metaphysics of consciousness.</p>

<p class='c028'>After discussing the primary and secondary (so-called) qualities of matter,
as tabulated by Mill, Hamilton and others, Mr. Sundaram Iyer passes on the
question: “What is force?”</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Force <em>is</em> matter ... it may be related to matter in ... four ways:—firstly, it may be an
extraneous power to matter, acting upon it from without; secondly, it may be an inherent power in
matter, influencing it from within, but yet distinct from the substance of matter; thirdly, it may be
an innate power in matter, influencing it from within, and not distinct from the substance of matter;
or fourthly, it may be a function of the substance of matter.” (p. 76-7.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>After an interesting criticism of current theories, he concludes that:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Function is simply the phenomenal effect of the latent cause, namely force, but never force itself.
This potential existence, which is in matter, <em>is a physical existence</em>. If not it cannot, as shown
before, produce any impression whatsoever upon or in the substance of matter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Matter is force and force is matter. It is not quite evident, however, whether
this position is strictly reconcilable with the remark that “the primary qualities
of matter are all simplifiable into ... extension and (its) motion (actual or
<a id='corr409.47'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='possible).'>possible).”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_409.47'><ins class='correction' title='possible).'>possible).”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>If force is a <em>physical existence</em>, and the real <em>substance</em> of matter at the same
time, we get back no further into the mystery of what things-in-themselves
really are. Physical existence remains the reality behind physical existence and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the realization of matter and force, as aspects only of one basis, in no way
simplifies the crux.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is not clear, moreover, what is the exact meaning the author intends by
the use of the word “force.” Is it motion—molar or molecular—or the unknown
cause of motion? According to Professor Huxley, “force” is merely an expression
used to denote the <em>cause</em> of motion, whatever that may be. We only <em>know</em>
this cause in its <em>aspect</em> of motion, and cannot penetrate behind the veil in
order to grasp the Noumenon of which motion is the phenomenal effect. The
necessity, therefore, of recognising the fact that <em>motion</em> is all that falls within the
cognizance of sense, forbids the (profane) scientist to use the term “force” as
representative of anything but an abstraction. The question is complicated by
the consideration that the <em>substantiality</em> of various so-called “forces” appears
most probable, and that this substantiality becomes objectively real to sense,
only on a plane beyond this—the domain of matter in its order of physical
differentiations.</p>

<p class='c028'>The materialistic doctrine that force merely = a motion of matter is contradicted
by the fact that, as shown by Mill, <em>motion can be temporarily neutralized</em>.
Lift a heavy weight on to a shelf and the mechanical energy expended in the
act is latent in the potentiality of the weight to fall to the ground again. There
is <em>no immediate equivalent</em>, as the attraction of the earth for the object remains
the same (the now greater distance tending to diminish the amount though in
a very minute degree.)</p>

<p class='c028'>It may be further noted that, granting Mr. Sundaram Iyer’s definition of
matter as “<em>extension pure and simple</em>,” to be correct (p. 112), it is difficult to
understand how he predicates this barren content as endowed with <em>motion</em>
(p. 83.) What moves?</p>

<p class='c028'>The rest of the <em>brochure</em> is taken up with some excellent criticism of current
conceptions of atoms, space and heterogenealism (a creed now so sorely wounded
by Mr. Crooke’s “Protyle.”) Dealing with one of the late Mr. G. H. Lewe’s
utterances, the author remarks with great truth: “By some mysterious law of
occurrence the self-contradictions of the bulk of the erudite and enlightened
are in point of gravity, palpableness, and number in direct proportion to their
erudition and enlightenment.” With how many contrasted dicta from the pages
of our Büchners, Spencers, Bains etc., etc., could this conclusion be supported.</p>

<p class='c028'>One word before we close. Is the title of the work well chosen? It appears
to us the least satisfactory sentence which has been traced by the writer’s
pen. The definition of “mind as matter and matter as mind” not only offers
no solution of the great psychological problem discussed, but does injustice to
the contents of the work itself.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the process of definition we “assemble representative examples of the
phenomena,” under investigation and “our work lies in generalizing these, in
detecting community in the midst of difference.” Now, there is <em>no community
whatever</em> between mental and material facts. For as Professor Bain writes:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Extension is but the first of a long series of properties all present in matter,
<em>all absent in mind</em> ... our mental experience, our feelings and thoughts, have
no <em>extension</em>, no <em>place</em>, no <em>form</em><a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c013'><sup>[133]</sup></a> or <em>outline</em>, or <em>mechanical division</em> of parts; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>we are incapable of attending to anything mental until we shut off the view of
all that.”—“<cite>Mind and Body.</cite>” pp. 125 and 135.</p>

<p class='c028'>The phenomenal contrast of mind and matter is not only at the root of <a id='corr411.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='uor'>our</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_411.3'><ins class='correction' title='uor'>our</ins></a></span>
present constitution but an essential of our terrestrial consciousness. Duality
is illusion in the ultimate analysis; but within the limits of a Universe-cycle or
Great Manwantaræ it holds true. The <em>two</em> bases of manifested Being—the
Logos (spirit) and Mulaprakriti, (Matter, or rather its Noumenon) are unified in
the absolute reality, but in the Manvantaric Maya, under space and time conditions,
they <em>are contrasted though mutually interdependent aspects of the</em> <span class='fss'>ONE
CAUSE</span>.</p>

of such writers as G. M. McC. An extract from one of the latter’s letters to
the “<cite>Secular Review</cite>” (January 7, 1888), for instance, says that “Specialism <em>is</em>

<h3 class='c018'>THE CHURCH AND THE DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c034'>
    <div><i>To the Editors of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>As it is often supposed that the clergy are required to be united as one man in
teaching a doctrine called Atonement, and that this doctrine requires the clergy
either to teach that “God required the blood of Jesus to be shed and offered
as a sacrifice for an Atonement,” or to leave the Church if they reject it;
therefore, since I reject this doctrine, it is sometimes wondered how I can
either have been admitted to ordination, or, being admitted, how I can remain
in, or expect to have a hearing in, the pulpits of the National Churches.</p>

<p class='c028'><em>The explanation</em> of my position is as follows:</p>

<p class='c028'>I offered myself as a candidate for ordination much later than is usual; and
<em>one</em> of the three beneficed clergy, whose testimonials, as to the candidate’s
religious views being orthodox, each candidate is required to provide before
being accepted as a candidate for examination and ordination, <em>informed</em> the
Bishop of London (Jackson) that I did not hold Church of England views on
the Atonement. The Bishop, therefore, before accepting me as a candidate,
required a personal interview; when I told the Bishop, in reply to his question,
whether I had any difficulty in accepting the <a id='corr412.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='doctine'>doctrine</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_412.19'><ins class='correction' title='doctine'>doctrine</ins></a></span> of Atonement as taught in
the second of the XXXIX. Articles, that I was entering the Church in order to
teach, that it was the work of Jesus Christ to devote His life a living sacrifice to
persuade us to believe that in His love, His mind, His spirit towards us, we
saw (so far as it could be manifested in the human form) the love, mind, and
spirit of God towards us; and that the sacrifice of Jesus consisted in His leaving
nothing undone that love could do or suffer, even to drinking to its very
dregs the cup of our hatred, whilst blind and ignorant, in order that we might
accept and believe His testimony.</p>

<p class='c028'>And, in addition, I told the Bishop that if the XXXIX. Articles did not allow
of this teaching, and demanded of the clergy to believe and teach that “God
required the blood of Jesus to be shed and offered as a sacrifice for an Atonement,
either to appease God’s wrath, satisfy His justice, or propitiate His favour,”
then such a doctrine was immoral, anti-Christian, contrary to the Scriptures, and
made God to be no better than Shylock, a wolf, or a devil. And I dared the
Bishop to refuse accepting me as a candidate.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Bishop made no reply, neither assenting nor dissenting, and I returned
to Petersham to await the result of this interview. After a day or two the
Bishop’s chaplain wrote that I might consider my proposal to come to the
Bishop’s examination for Orders accepted; and I was ordained without one
word of comment upon the conversation at this private interview. But my first
vicar only allowed me to preach three times, and then for the rest of the year
he boycotted me from either preaching, reading, or even speaking in the parish,
excepting only in a particular part of it. My second vicar, after allowing me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>to preach three times, also boycotted me entirely. I appealed to the Bishop,
but he declined to interfere. So after striving in vain to find a clergyman who
would allow me to preach what I was ordained to teach, I published pamphlets,
and delivered them by the hundred and thousand at the church doors after the
service, wherever there was a large congregation; but after a time the Bishop
was appealed to to stop me; when he not only denied me, as Peter denied Jesus,
but he threatened to instruct the police to prevent me; and the ruling powers
at St Paul’s Cathedral did instruct the chief of the police to prevent me.</p>

<p class='c028'>As a last resort, I write letters in the Press wherever I can find a newspaper willing
to open its columns, to explain my views and appeal to the people to obtain liberty
in the Church for teaching the truth of “Christ Crucified.” But so great
is the opposition to this, that the chief organ of the Church and the
Press (the <cite>Times</cite>) refuses even to allow me to advertise for a pulpit, on the
ground that it is <em>inadmissible</em>; notwithstanding all the minutest details of
divorce trials are freely <em>admissible</em>, thus proving that everything is admissible
excepting one thing, viz.: the truth of Christ Crucified.</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet the Archbishop of Canterbury has recently told the world that “<a id='corr413.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the,'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_413.16'><ins class='correction' title='the,'>the</ins></a></span>
Church wishes the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to be told,”
and the Bishops of Carlisle, Durham, Peterborough, Manchester, Liverpool and
Bedford, have also used words to the same effect. But although I have spent
the best part of my life (17 years) in striving to find one clergyman (from the
highest to the lowest), I have not found one who would allow this liberty to
speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, concerning Christ
Crucified. And I appeal to the rulers of the Church to allow this liberty—and to
the people to demand and obtain this liberty, if the rulers of the Church refuse
it. For I have a letter from Canon Liddon, in which he says to me, “I can
believe with all my heart, although I only know you from the two letters which
you have written to me (upon my sermons), that if you were to preach, people
would go to hear you as they go to hear me.” Is there not a cause then, why I
should complain of being thus cruelly and unjustly boycotted for 17 years without
any reason?</p>

<p class='c028'>The chief organ of the Church and the Press (the <cite>Times</cite>) in the
supposed chief Christian city in the world, refused to publish, even as an
advertisement, any one of the three following appeals, on the ground that they
were <em>inadmissible</em>. Yes, <em>inadmissible</em>, whilst all the minutest details of the Barrett
trial, the Dilke trial, the Colin Campbell trial, the Seabright trial, and a host of
others of a like nature, were all <em>freely admissible</em>.</p>

liberty), but may verily be seen to be, as it is, and as St. Paul asserted

<p class='c028'>[This persistent refusal is the more remarkable as other preachers are allowed
to teach worse, <em>from an orthodox standpoint, of course</em>. Is it <em>inadmissible</em> “to
explain the mystery of Christ Crucified,” as the Rev. Mr. Headley is likely to,
lest it should interfere with the explanation and description of Jehovah—“<em>one
with Christ Jesus</em>” in the orthodox dogma—by the Rev. H. R. Haweis, M. A.?
Says this truthful and cultured if not very pious orator: “At first the chief
attributes of Satan were given to Jehovah. It was God who destroyed
the world, hardened Pharaoh, tempted David, provoked to sin, and punished
the sinner. This way of thinking lingered even as late as 700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>: ‘I
the Lord make peace and create evil’ (Isa. xlv. 7). We have an odd survival
of this identification of God with the Devil in the word ‘<em>Deuce</em>,’ which is none
other than ‘<em>Deus</em>,’ but which to us always means the Devil. As the Jew grew
more spiritual he gradually transferred the devilish functions to a ‘Satan,’ or
accusing spirit. The transition point appears in comparing the early passage (2
Sam. xxiv.), when <em>God</em> is said to ‘move’ David to number the people, with the
later (1 Chron. xxi.), where <em>Satan</em> is said to be the instigator who ‘provoked’
the numbering. But Satan is not yet the King Devil. We can take up our
Bible and trace the gradual transformation of Satan from an accusing angel
into the King Devil of popular theology.”—(<em>The Key</em>, etc p. 22.) This, we
believe, is an even more damaging teaching for the Orthodox Church than any
theory about “Christ Crucified.” Mr. Headley seeks to prove Christ, the Rev.
Haweis ridiculing and making away with the Devil, <em>destroys and makes away
for ever with Jesus</em>, as Christ, also. For, as logically argued by Cardinal Ventura
de Raulica, “<em>to demonstrate the existence of Satan, is to re-establish</em> <span class='fss'>ONE OF
THE FUNDAMENTAL DOGMAS OF THE CHURCH</span>, <em>which serves as a basis for
Christianity, and without which</em>, Satan (and Jesus) would be but names”; or
to put it in the still stronger terms of the pious Chevalier des Mousseaux,
“<em>The Devil is the chief pillar of Faith</em> ... if it was not for him, the
Saviour, the Crucified, the Redeemer, would be but the most ridiculous of
supernumeraries, and the Cross an insult to good sense.” (See <cite>Isis Unveil.</cite> vol.
i., 103; vol. ii., 14.) Truly so. Were there no Devil, a Christ to save the
World from him would be hardly wanted! Yet, the Rev. Haweis says: (p. 24)
“I cannot now discuss the teaching of the N. T. on the King Devil, or I
might show that Jesus did not endorse the popular view of one King Devil,
and ... notice the way in which our translators have played fast and loose
with the words <em>Diabolus and Satan</em>;” adding that the Tree and Serpent
worship was an Oriental cult, “of which the narrative of Adam and Eve is a
Semitic form.” Is this <em>admissible</em> orthodoxy?—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>

    <div><i>To the Editors of</i> <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Mesdames</span>,—In the December number of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> Mr. J. B. Bright takes
exception to some remarks on Socialism in an article on “Brotherhood,” which
appeared in your pages a month previously.</p>

<p class='c028'>As the writer of that article, I think it right to accept Mr. Bright’s challenge,
and endeavour to replace my somewhat hasty generalisations by a more precise
statement of the teachings of Theosophy, as they appear to me to bear on the
question at issue.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Bright objects to my use of the phrase “<em>materialistic</em> Socialism.” My
intention was to draw a distinction between that which “concerns itself
primarily with the material or physical condition of mankind,” and that other
form of purely voluntary association, springing, as regards each of its members,
from a recognition of their unity of purpose, and the realisation of the idea of
brotherhood, for an example of which we may turn to the communistic system
of the early Christian Church. I would point out that this is not a fanciful
distinction, as in the first case what is described as “a juster distribution of
wealth” is the very essence of the Socialistic idea, while in the second it is
only an incident, arising from the conviction that worldly possessions have in
themselves no value in comparison with “the things of the spirit.” I maintain
then that the teachings of Theosophy are opposed to “modern materialistic
Socialism,” and I will endeavour to point out, as briefly as possible, in what this
opposition consists.</p>

<p class='c028'>There is at the outset a fundamental difference between Theosophy and
Socialism in the value they attach to the “material and physical” well-being of
mankind. Theosophy regards any given earth life as an infinitesimal link in the
chain of lives which leads from the first glimmerings of a separate consciousness
up to the very threshold of Divinity and All-knowledge. And taking the
doctrines of Re-incarnation and Karma, as interacting laws, it sees in the
apparent injustices of physical life, and in the inequalities of intellectual and
moral development among mankind, the results of good or bad use made of
opportunities in previous incarnations. The Universe is governed by the great
law of Harmony, whose agent is Karma, and infractions of this law, or rebellion
against it, are punished by the action of Karma, whether in the individual or
the race. Thus the position of every individual in respect to his fellow men,
and the position of every nation (the compound, as it were, of individual
Karmas) in respect to other nations, is the direct result of previously acquired
characteristics and affinities. The re-incarnation of an individual will be
governed by his personal affinities; firstly, to the general Karma of his nation:
secondly, to the particular circumstances of his parentage and condition in life.
Theosophy therefore teaches that so far as regards his individual Karma, a
man’s place in Society is what he has made it, and he has no right to cry out
against the injustice of the law which he has broken, and which inexorably
exacts the penalty of his default. This does not however quite hold good as
regards the national or the cyclic Karma. It is quite possible that by the
action of cyclic Karma injustice may be done to individuals, to be atoned for
no doubt in future existences, but at the same time calculated to impede their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>due and regular development. The combating of this cyclic Karma, in so far
as it deals unjustly with individuals, is the work of the great and wise ones of
this earth, and every true Theosophist will to the best of his ability take part in
the struggle. But the Socialist movement is itself a part of the cyclic Karma,
and in its endeavour to rectify what seem, from its limited point of view, injustices,
it cannot fail to be unjust to those the justice of whose position in life
it declines to recognise. Thus it cannot be otherwise than that it should meet
with opposition from those whose object is the improvement of humanity as a
whole.</p>

<p class='c028'>I must in the second place point out that the teaching of Theosophy is
entirely opposed to the idea that any very great progress can be made by
humanity as a whole, within the space of a few generations. Speaking of the
destruction of evil in the human heart, the author of “Light on the Path”
says, “Only the strong can kill it out. The weak must wait for its growth, its
fruition, its death. And it is a plant which lives and increases throughout the
ages. It flowers when man has accumulated unto himself innumerable existences.”
This is undoubtedly Theosophical teaching, but I do not think it
tallies with Mr. Bright’s view that “this self same society——contains
within it all the germs of such a reconstruction of the physical environment as
shall shortly place the means of spiritual and psychical regeneration within the
reach of all.” It is impossible that Socialism or any other external organisation
can “raise the intellectual and instinctive moral standard of the whole community
to such an extent that all will, in the next generation after the Social
Revolution, be amenable to the truths” of Theosophy. This would be
equivalent to saying that every member of the community was prepared
definitely to undertake the task of self-conquest, and it happens unfortunately
that almost all the external work of Socialism is in the opposite direction.
Further, it must be distinctly pointed out that this task of self-conquest must
be undertaken and carried through by each man for himself, and only those
who have reached a certain point in human evolution are ready for the struggle.
There is one other point on which I feel some stress must be laid. It seems
to me impossible that Theosophy, recognising as it does the immense gulf
which exists between ordinary humanity (in which term I of course include all
its followers), and those who are on the threshold of Divinity, can fail to recognise
at the same time the principle of hierarchy in its best and noblest
sense. I mean of course a spiritual hierarchy, but even this is incompatible
with that innate hatred of domination which is so obvious in Socialism.
There is no doubt some inconsistency in this hatred of domination, as in
practice Socialists are prepared to substitute for the existing domination of
intelligence that of mere numbers, but this, if anything, only makes the contrast
between the two ideas somewhat stronger. It is only right to point out
that an accepted disciple (not a mere student) practically surrenders his personal
liberty, and pledges himself to obedience to those great ones who are the
initiators of the Theosophical movement.</p>

<p class='c028'>I have endeavoured thus far to particularise my general statement that the
teachings of Theosophy were opposed to Socialism. I think Mr. Bright’s
objections to my other statements are in effect answered in what I have already
said, but I may perhaps be permitted to deal with them separately. If Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Bright has understood the meaning of the article on Brotherhood, he will, I
think, see that whereas the Theosophical idea of brotherhood is based on the
identity of the Divine spirit inherent in humanity, and thence working downwards,
the brotherhood of Socialism is based on the assumption of equality on
the material, or intellectual plane, and has, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, no existence at all on the
higher plane. The brotherhood of Theosophy, once rightly understood, will
no doubt be manifested on the lower planes, but that does not make it the
same thing as an idea of Brotherhood which begins and ends in physical
existence.</p>

<p class='c028'>As to my remark that Socialism is an attempt to interfere with the action of
the Laws of Karma, I should perhaps have added the word “individual,”
which, in conjunction with my reference to the parable of the talents, should
make the meaning clear. Socialism aims at the levelling of classes, which is
nothing else than a redistribution of the responsibilities of life. I understand
the parable of the talents to indicate the true meaning of the differences in
opportunities accorded to individuals during their life on earth. Every
opportunity is also a responsibility, and from those to whom much is given
much will be demanded. Further, responsibility is thrust upon those who can
bear it, and to relieve them from it, and transfer <a id='corr417.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it the'>it to the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_417.19'><ins class='correction' title='it the'>it to the</ins></a></span> shoulders of the weaker
brethren, is an interference with the laws of Karma, and can only lead to a
retardation of the general evolution of humanity. I will only say in conclusion
that I have endeavoured to confine my remarks to the view of Socialism advanced
by Mr. Bright. It is indeed hardly necessary to point out that Theosophy
can never be a party to the incitements to violence, and the appeals to the
baser passions which Mr. Bright rightly deprecates, but which are unfortunately
too often the stock-in-trade of the Socialist orator.</p>

<p class='c028'>I feel that there are many points in Mr. Bright’s letter to which I should be
glad to reply more in detail, but I fear that in so doing I might be considered
as trenching too much on those purely political aspects of the question which
are outside the scope of Theosophical work.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>WHAT IS THEOSOPHY?</h4>

<p class='c035'><em>The question is answered by Schopenhauer as follows</em>:</p>

<p class='c028'>“... Starting from the plane of <em>mental conception</em> (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vorstellung</cite></span>), and
proceeding on our way towards the attainment of <em>objective knowledge</em>, we shall
never be able to arrive at a higher point than our own conception (imagination),
<i>i.e.</i> of the external appearance of the object of our observation; but we shall
never be able to penetrate into the interior of the things and to find out what
they really are (not what they merely appear to be). So far I agree with <em>Kant</em>.
But as a counterpoise to this truth I have called attention to another one;
namely, that we are not merely the <em>cognising subject</em>, but we are also ourselves
a part of object of our cognition, we are ourselves the <em>Thing itself</em>. There is
consequently an interior way open to us from that self-existing and interior
essence of things, which we cannot approach from the outside; a kind of subterranean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>passage, a secret connection, by which we by treason, as it were,
may at once penetrate into a fortress which was impregnable from the outside.
The <em>Thing itself</em> can as such enter our consciousness only in a direct manner,
<i>i.e.</i> <em>by becoming conscious of its own self</em>. To attempt to know it objectively is
to ask for a self-contradiction.” (<cite>The World as Will and Conception.</cite> Vol. ii.,
Cap. 18).</p>

<p class='c028'>What Schopenhauer expresses in modern philosophical language might
perhaps be stated in a few words by saying, that man cannot become conscious
of the truth unless the truth is in him, and in that case it is not the man who
recognises the truth, but the truth which recognises itself in man. He who
wants to know it objectively must separate himself from it, because no one can
see his own face without the help of a mirror; but if he separates himself
from it, the truth exists in him no longer. It is therefore the truth itself
which may become self-conscious in man, provided there exists any truth
in him.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>A NOTE OF EXPLANATION.</h4>

<p class='c035'>I would much rather suffer an unintentional misrepresentation of my meaning
than take the trouble to reply, and have no desire to magnify small matters of
difference. But a very critical friend calls my attention to certain statements
and apparent discrepancies in the “Esoteric Character of the Gospels,” on
which I will beg leave to say a word.</p>

<p class='c028'>I find it affirmed on p. 300, in a foot-note, that “Mr. G. Massey is not correct
in saying that ‘<i>The Gnostic form of the name Chrest or Chrestos denotes the Good
God, not a human original,’ for it denoted the latter, that is, a good, holy man.</i>”
But either the statement has no meaning as an answer to me, or it is based on a
misunderstanding of mine.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c013'><sup>[135]</sup></a> I was showing that the <em>original</em> Christ of the Gnosis
was not one particular form of human personality, like the supposed historic
Christ, and that the name denoted a divine, and not a human <em>original</em>. I was
perfectly well aware, as your quotations show, that the name was <em>afterwards</em>
conferred on the “good” as the Chrestoi or Chrestiani. Nor do I say, or anywhere
imply, that the “<em>Karest</em>,” or mummy-type of immortality <em>was</em> the <em>only
form of the Christ</em>, as your quotations again will prove. I have written enough
about that Gnostic Christ who was the Immortal Self in man, the reflection of,
or emanation from, the divine nature in humanity, and in both sexes, not merely
in one.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c013'><sup>[136]</sup></a> This is the Christ that never could become a one person or be limited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>to one sex. This you accept and preach; yet you can add “<i>Still the personage
(Jesus) so addressed by Paul—wherever he lived—was a great initiate, and a
‘Son of God.’</i>”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c013'><sup>[137]</sup></a> But the Christos of Paul, being the Gnostic Christ, as you
admit (301), it cannot be a personage named Jesus, or a great Initiate, who
was addressed by him. It appears to me that in passages like these, you are
giving away all that is worth contending for, and vouching for that which never
has been, and never can be, proved. I have searched for Jesus
many years in the Gospels and elsewhere without being able to catch hold
of the hem of the garment of any human personality. Ben-Pandira we know
a little of, but cannot make him out in the Christ of the Gospels. The Christ of
the Gnosis can be identified, but not with any historic Jesus.</p>

<p class='c028'>We do not go to the Christian Gospels to learn the true nature of the Christ,
or the incarnation according to the Gnostic religion (I use this term in preference
to yours of the “Wisdom-Religion,” as being more definite and explanatory;
not as a religion, supposed by the <em>Idiotai</em> to have followed in the wake of
Historic Christianity!). These were known in Egypt, more than six thousand
years ago. When the monuments began the Cult of the Supreme God Atum
was extant. We know not how many æons earlier, but six thousand years will
do. Atum = Adam was the divine father of an eternal soul which was personated
as his son, named Iu-em-hept (the Greek Imothos or Æsculapius), an image of
whom used to be seen (on shelf 3,578, b. 1874), in the British Museum. He
was the second Atum = Adam, and is called the “Eternal Word” in the Ritual.
In external phenomena this type represented the Solar God, re-born monthly
or annually in the lunar orb; in human phenomena the Christ or Son of God
as the essential and eternal soul in man. But he was neither a man nor an Initiate.
He was just what the Logos, the Word of Truth or Ma-Kheru, the
Buddha or Christ is in other Cults.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c013'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>I cordially agree with “M,” a correspondent whom you quote, and wish that
all our orthodox friends would as frankly face the facts. If any historic Jesus
ever did claim to be the Gnostic Christ made flesh<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c013'><sup>[139]</sup></a> once for all, he would be
the supremest impostor in history.</p>

<p class='c028'>Let us define to ourselves very strictly what it is we do mean, or we shall introduce
the direst confusion into the conflict, and we shall be unable to distinguish
the face of friend from foe in the cloud of battle-dust which we may raise.
What I find is, that Historic Christianity was based either upon the suppression
or the perversion of all that <em>was</em> esoteric in Gnostic Christianity. And to bring
any aid from the one to the support of the other is to try and re-establish with
the left hand all that you are knocking down with the right.</p>

<p class='c028'>I am also taken to task on page 307 for alluding to the Bible as a “Magazine
of falsehoods already exploded, or just going off,” by the writer who adds force
to my words later on in characterizing these same writings as a “Magazine of
(<em>wicked</em>) falsehoods”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c013'><sup>[140]</sup></a> (p. 178), which was going farther than I went, who do set
down as much to ignorance as to knavery. What I meant was, that the “Fall
of Man” in the Old Testament, is a falsification of fable, now exploded, and
that the redemption from that fall, which is promised in the New, whether by
an “Initiate” or “Son of God” is a fraud based on the fable, and a falsehood
that is going to be exploded. There is no call to mix up the Book of the Dead,
the Vedas, or any other sacred writings, in this matter. Each tub must stand
on its own bottom, and the one that won’t, can’t hold water.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c013'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>P.S. By the by, I see the Adventists, and other misleading Delusionists are
all agog just now about the wonderful fulfilment of prophecy, and corroboration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>of historic fact, that we are now witnessing. The “Star of Bethlehem” has reappeared,
so they say, to prove the truth of the Christian story. But, sad
to say, it is not the star of Christ that is now visible in the south-east before sunrise
every morning. It is Venus in her heliacal rising. It is Venus as the
Maleess, or Lucifer as “Sun of the Morning.” This particular Star of Bethlehem—there
are various others less brilliant and less noticeable—generally does
return once every nineteen months or so, when the planet Venus is the Morning
Star. Only the gaping camel-swallowers, who know all about the “Star of
Bethlehem,” and the fulfilment of prophecy, are not up in Astronomy, and they
will no doubt squirm and strain at this small gnat of real fact offered to them
by way of an explanation.</p>

<p class='c035'>The primacy of Self is indisputable, if by reason of one fact only—that this,
self-same, Self is the initial postulate of all sane philosophy. And, when
Philosophy soars to Metaphysic, Scientific Analysis “takes up the wondrous
tale,” and its burden is Self-hood also. All roads lead to Rome. All analysis
runs into the Egoistic Synthesis. “The One [Ego] remains, the Many change
and pass.” Yet the passing is only the flux and ebb of the One. In Hegel’s
words, “that which passes away passes away into its own self: only the passing
away passes away.” Which things are an allegory, and yet “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>solvitur ambulando</i></span>.”
A recent traveller in the United States tells us, that, in the Emerson country,
he chanced upon cross-roads, and found there an apparently contradictory
direction-post. One arm of it bore the inscription, “This is the way to Concord,”
the other, pointing in the opposite direction, was similarly worded, “This is the
way to Concord.” The Hylo-Ideal Thesis is this Ideal Concord, to be reached
whether you travel by way of Eastern Idealism, or by the route of plainer
Western Materialism. For, and here all contradictions are reconciled, in the
one Subject-object which is Self, there is no diversity, neither Jew nor Greek,
neither Idealism only, nor Materialism only, or exclusively, but all is one.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c013'><sup>[142]</sup></a>
And in Unity there is no class distinction, no nomenclature, no “otherness,”
no Ebal <em>and</em> Gerizim, but only the Mount of God. What the Ego is, <em>all</em> is.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c013'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
It is the <em>x</em> of every problem and answers to any value save the spurious and
indifferent one of the Dualist.</p>

<p class='c028'>I find Hylo-Idealism (Auto-centricism)—this “pearl of great price”—canvassed
and examined by many modern thinkers, only to be contemptuously
cast away, though it would have made each one of them in turn “richer than
all his tribe.” But it was ever thus. In this rejection there is no despair in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the view of the <em>illuminati</em>. All is ours, and paltering with the central truth of
SOLIPSISM, as men have ever paltered, does not change or diminish the truth
itself, or lessen the assurance of its ultimate victory, since to go from, or flee
from, the Egoistic presence is an impossibility. We wander here and there, but
to seek to transcend ourselves is vain. There must, sooner or later, be the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>resipiscentia</i></span>, the coming home at last to Self, and Self only, as to the better
home at last.</p>

<p class='c028'>In this view there is no <em>Logos</em>—save that indisputable one, which maketh all
things to every one of us—no “true Light” save that effulgent one which
“lighteth every man that cometh into the world,” namely, his own creative and
illuminating Egoity—<em>sans</em> which there is but nothingness. Such a Gospel
as this should be termed the Evangel of common-sense were it not that that
phrase shows only one side of the question—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Virginibus, puerisque est</i></span>” but it
is also the very acme of the exalted intelligence, “the last and sharpest height”
of human thought where the atmosphere is all too rare for mortal breath.</p>

<p class='c028'>The highest and the lowliest<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c013'><sup>[144]</sup></a> are ever thus akin—“Aryan worship secreted in
the Holy of Holies the utensils of the dairy.” Grasp but the centre truth of
truths—that the Ego and its products are <em>one</em>, that every one of us spins, from
his own consciousness, the web of thing and circumstance, which envelopes
him—and you see at once and as it were instinctively, that in this Universe-circle
of Egoity there is no “otherness” even thinkable, no lower and no
higher, no difference, nothing essentially common or unclean, everything being,
not so much cleansed of God, as very THEOBROMA,<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c013'><sup>[145]</sup></a> God’s food and

<p class='c028'>Thus <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>veræ causæ</i></span> and other figments are not so much unsearchable, or past
finding out, as out of court or indifferent. Whether all be of God, or all be
from a “clam-shell,” does not matter—does not, by one jot, affect our Thesis.
Indifferently we are by origin, patricians or “gutter-snipes.” The Ego is free
of the Cosmos—equal to either fortune, high or low, makes <em>its own</em> universe,

<h4 class='c023'>GERALD MASSEY ON SHAKSPEARE.</h4>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c035'>Mr. Massey has sent us a circular, the contents of which should be of interest
to the lovers of Shakspeare and the buyers of rare books. The writer says:</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>“My work on the Secret Drama of Shakspeare’s Sonnets, with
Sketches of his Private Friends, and of his own Life and Character, first
published in the year 1866, the Second Edition of which was issued,
with a Supplement, for Subscribers in 1872, has now been out of print
many years. It is frequently enquired for, and very rarely to be found
in the catalogues of second-hand booksellers. Therefore I am about to
reproduce the work. It will have to be re-cast and re-written where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>necessary, as the writing can now be more definitely done. Errors must
be confessed and corrected. The new volume will be on lines similar
to those of the earlier work, accentuated in many of the details, but
modified in others. There will be something new and more decisive to
say concerning both sets of the Sonnets, which I call the Southampton
and Herbert series; and not without reason or warrant will the Comparative
method be pushed much farther than before. The work will
be written up to date in the light of the latest knowledge. The most
recent data, the latest results of Shakspearian Siftings, will be utilised;
and something will have to be said concerning the current Baconian
Craze, which was no doubt foreseen by the Great Humourist when he
wrote, ‘<em>A most fine figure! To prove you a Cypher!</em>’ is my aim to
fight one last battle on this field for what I maintain to be the cause of
truth and right; to entrust a final answer on the Sonnet question to
the types of John Guttenberg, and leave in his safe keeping a plea that
shall be heard hereafter, as a permanent memorial to the writer’s love
and admiration for Shakspeare the Poet and Man. After twenty years
the ground is felt to be firmer underfoot. The building will have a more
concrete base. I am enabled to give a closer clinch to my conclusions,
and, as I think, complete my case. Necessarily the book must be large,
700 or 800 pp. The price will be One Guinea.”</p>

<p class='c041'>Question, at London, 11.45 a.m., Feb.
26th, 1887.</p>

<p class='c028'>Will the quesited die from his present

<p class='c028'>Hearing by letter that my uncle, an
octogenarian, was seriously ill from pneumonia,
I drew a figure for the moment
of the impression to do so, which occurred
while reading the communication. His

<p class='c028'>As the quesited was the 4th of my
mother’s brothers and sisters, my mother
being the 8th and last, I took the 10th
house of the figure for herself, the 12th
(or 3rd from the 10th) for her eldest
brother or sister, the 2nd for the 2nd,
the 4th for the 3rd, the 6th for the 4th—the
quesited—and the 1st (the 8th from
the 6th) for his 8th, or house of death.
♂ was lord of his first house, and ☽ of his
8th. The aspect was ☽ 25° 51’ 5” ♂,
separating from the quindecile, and applying
to the semisextile. As the significators
were in good aspects, separating
from one and applying to the other, and
within orbs of both, it signified sure
recovery; more especially as ♂ received
☽ by house, and was dignified by triplicity.
Nevertheless, the severity of the illness
was shown by <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Cauda Draconis</i></span> in quesited’s
4th house; by ♄, lord of quesited’s
4th, posited in quesited’s 8th, retrograde,
in his detriment, and in close □ to ☽, lady
of quesited’s 8th and posited in his 6th.
Furthermore, as ☽, the applying planet
of the two significators, was in a cardinal
sign and in a succeedent house of the
figure, each degree signified a week;
therefore as ☽ wanted 4° 8’ 55” of the
perfect semisextile aspect, I judged that
he would be convalescent in 4 weeks and
1 day, or March 27th. <em>On March 29th

<div class='footnote' id='f135'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r135'>135</a>. The remark made has never been meant as “an answer,” but simply as an observation that the
word “Chrestos” applied to a “good man,” a “human original,” and not to a “good God only.”
If such was not the intention of Mr. Massey, and he amplifies his idea elsewhere, it was not so
amplified in his article in the “Agnostic Annual.” It is, therefore, simply a bare statement of facts
referring to that particular article and no more. I do not for one moment oppose Mr. Massey’s
conclusions, nor doubt his undeniable learning in the direction of those particular researches, <i>i.e.</i>,
about the words “Christos” and “Chrestos.” What I say is, that he limits them to the negation of
an historical Christ, and, for reasons no doubt very weighty, does not touch upon their principal
esoteric meaning in the temple-phraseology of the Mysteries.—H.P.B.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f136'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r136'>136</a>. This is absolutely and preeminently a Theosophical doctrine taught ever since 1875, when the

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f137'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r137'>137</a>. This, I am afraid, is a misunderstanding (due, no doubt, to my own fault) on the part of our
learned correspondent, of the meaning that was intended to be conveyed in the articles now criticized.
If he goes to the trouble of reading over again the paragraph that misled him (see p. 307, 5th paragraph),
he will, perhaps, see that it is so. That which was really meant was that, though the terms
<em>Christos</em> and <em>Chréstos</em> are generic surnames, still, the personage so addressed (not by Paul, necessarily,
but by any one), was a great Initiate and a “Son of God.” It is the name “Jesus,” placed in the
sentence in parentheses that made it both clumsy and misleading. Whether Paul knew of Jehoshua
Ben Pandira (and he must have heard of him), or not, he could never have applied the surname used
by him to Jesus or any other <em>historic</em> Christ. Otherwise his <cite>Epistles</cite> would not have been
withheld and exiled as they were. The sentence which precedes the two incriminated statements,
shows that no such thing, as understood by Mr. Massey, could have been really meant, as it is
said “Occultism pure and simple finds the same mystic elements in the Christian as in other
faiths, <em>though it rejects emphatically its dogmatic and historic character</em>.” The two statements,
viz., that Jesus or Jehoshua Ben Pandira <em>whenever he lived</em>, was a great Initiate and the “Son
of God”—just as Apollonius of Tyana was—and that Paul never meant either him or any other living
Initiate, but a metaphysical Christos present in, and <em>personal</em> to, every mystic Gnostic as to every initiated
Pagan—are not at all irreconcileable. A man may know of several great Initiates, and yet place
his own ideal on a far higher pedestal than any of these.—[H.P.B.]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f138'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r138'>138</a>. Nor shall I dispute this statement in general. But this does not invalidate in one iota
<em>my</em> claim. The temple priests assumed the names of the gods they served, and this is as well known
a fact, as that the defunct Egyptian became an “Osiris”—was “osirified”—after his death. Yet
Osiris was assuredly neither “man nor an Initiate,” but a being hardly recognised as such by the
Royal Society of materialistic science. Why, then, could not an “Initiate,” who had succeeded in
merging his spiritual being into the <em>Christos state</em>, be regarded as a Christos after his last and supreme
initiation, just as he was called <em>Chrestos</em> before that? Neither Plotinus, Porphyry nor Apollonius
were Christians, yet, according to esoteric teaching, Plotinus realized this sublime state (of becoming
or uniting himself with his <em>Christos</em>) six times, Apollonius of Tyana four times, while Porphyry reached
the exalted state only once, when over sixty years of age. The Gnostics called the “<em>Word</em>”
“Abraxas” and “Christos” indiscriminately, and by whatever name we may call it, whether Ma-Kheru,
or Christos or Abraxas, it is all one. That mystic state which gives to our inner being the
impulse that attracts “the soul toward its origin and centre, the Eternal good,” as Plotinus teaches,
and makes of man a god, the Christos or the unknown made manifest, is a preeminently theosophical
condition. It belonged to the temple mysteries, and the teachings of the Neo-Platonists.—[H.P.B.]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f139'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r139'>139</a>. “Christ made flesh,” would be a claim worse than imposture, as it would be <em>absurdity</em>, but a
man of flesh assuming the <em>Christ-condition</em> temporarily, is indeed an occult, yet living, fact.—[<span class='sc'>Ed.</span>]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f140'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r140'>140</a>. Just so, if it has been originally written to be accepted in its dead letter sense. But, as I entirely
agree with Mr. Massey, that historic Christianity was based upon the suppression, and especially
the <em>perversion</em> of that which was esoteric in gnosticism, it is difficult to see in what it is that we
disagree? The perversion of esoteric facts in the gospels is not so cleverly done as to prevent the
true occultist from reading the Gospel narratives between the lines.—[H.P.B.]</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f141'>
<p class='c028'><a href='#r141'>141</a>. If Mr. G. Massey kindly waits till the conclusion of “the Esoteric character of the gospels” to
criticise the statements, he may perhaps arrive at the conviction that we are not so far apart in our
ideas upon this particular question as he seems to think. Of course my critic being an Egyptologist,
opposed to the Aryan theory, and arriving at his conclusions only by what he finds in strictly
authenticated and accepted documents—and I, as a Theosophist and an Occultist of a certain school,
accepting my proofs on data which he rejects—<i>i.e.</i> esoteric teachings—we can hardly agree upon
every point. But the question is not whether there was or never was an <em>historical</em> Christ, or Jesus,
between the years 1 and 33 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>—but simply were the Gospels of the gnostics (of Marcion and
others, for instance) perverted later by Christians—esoteric allegories founded on <em>facts</em>, or simply
meaningless fictions? I believe the former, and esoteric teachings explain many of the allegories.—[H.P.B.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>“What is Truth?” asked Pilate of one who, if the claims of
the Christian Church are even approximately correct, must
have known it. But He kept silent. And the truth which
He did not divulge, remained unrevealed, for his later followers as much
as for the Roman Governor. The silence of Jesus, however, on this
and other occasions, does not prevent his present followers from acting
as though they had received the ultimate and absolute Truth itself;
and from ignoring the fact that only such Words of Wisdom had been
given to them as contained a share of the truth, itself concealed in
parables and dark, though beautiful, sayings.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c013'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>This policy led gradually to dogmatism and assertion. Dogmatism
in churches, dogmatism in science, dogmatism everywhere. The
possible truths, hazily perceived in the world of abstraction, like those
inferred from observation and experiment in the world of matter, are
forced upon the profane multitudes, too busy to think for themselves,
under the form of <em>Divine revelation</em> and <em>Scientific authority</em>. But the
same question stands open from the days of Socrates and Pilate down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>to our own age of wholesale negation: is there such a thing as <em>absolute
truth</em> in the hands of any one party or man? Reason answers, “there cannot
be.” There is no room for absolute truth upon any subject whatsoever,
in a world as finite and conditioned as man is himself. But there are
relative truths, and we have to make the best we can of them.</p>

<p class='c028'>In every age there have been Sages who had mastered the absolute
and yet could teach but relative truths. For none yet, born of mortal
woman in <em>our</em> race, has, or could have given out, the whole and the final
truth to another man, for every one of us has to find that (to him) final
knowledge <em>in</em> himself. As no two minds can be absolutely alike, each
has to receive the supreme illumination <em>through</em> itself, according to its
capacity, and from no <em>human</em> light. The greatest adept living can reveal
of the Universal Truth only so much as the mind he is impressing it
upon can assimilate, and no more. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Tot homines, quot sententiæ</i></span>—is an
immortal truism. The sun is one, but its beams are numberless; and
the effects produced are beneficent or maleficent, according to the nature
and constitution of the objects they shine upon. Polarity is universal,
but the polariser lies in our own consciousness. In proportion as our consciousness
is elevated towards absolute truth, so do we men assimilate it
more or less absolutely. But man’s consciousness again, is only the sunflower
of the earth. Longing for the warm ray, the plant can only turn to
the sun, and move round and round in following the course of the
unreachable luminary: its roots keep it fast to the soil, and half its life
is passed in the shadow....</p>

<p class='c028'>Still each of us can relatively reach the Sun of Truth even on this
earth, and assimilate its warmest and most direct rays, however differentiated
they may become after their long journey through the physical
particles in space. To achieve this, there are two methods. On the
physical plane we may use our mental polariscope; and, analyzing the
properties of each ray, choose the purest. On the plane of spirituality,
to reach the Sun of Truth we must work in dead earnest for the
development of our higher nature. We know that by paralyzing
gradually within ourselves the appetites of the lower personality, and
thereby deadening the voice of the purely physiological mind—that
mind which depends upon, and is inseparable from, its medium or <em>vehicle</em>,
the organic brain—the animal man in us may make room for the spiritual;
and once aroused from its latent state, the highest spiritual senses and
perceptions grow in us in proportion, and develop <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>pari passu</i></span> with the
“divine man.” This is what the great adepts, the Yogis in the East
and the Mystics in the West, have always done and are still doing.</p>

<p class='c028'>But we also know, that with a few exceptions, no man of the world,
no materialist, will ever believe in the existence of such adepts, or even
in the possibility of such a spiritual or psychic development. “The
(ancient) fool hath said in his heart, There is no God”; the modern
says, “There are no adepts on earth, they are figments of your diseased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>fancy.” Knowing this we hasten to reassure our readers of the Thomas
Didymus type. We beg them to turn in this magazine to reading more
congenial to them; say to the miscellaneous papers on Hylo-Idealism,
by various writers.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c013'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>For <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> tries to satisfy its readers of whatever “school of
thought,” and shows itself equally impartial to Theist and Atheist, Mystic
and Agnostic, Christian and Gentile. Such articles as our
editorials, the Comments on “Light on the Path,” etc, etc.—are not
intended for Materialists. They are addressed to Theosophists, or
readers who know in their hearts that Masters of Wisdom <em>do</em> exist: and,
though <em>absolute</em> truth is not on earth and has to be searched for in higher
regions, that there still are, even on this silly, ever-whirling little globe
of ours, some things that are not even dreamt of in Western philosophy.</p>

<p class='c028'>To return to our subject. It thus follows that, though “general
<em>abstract</em> truth is the most precious of all blessings” for many of us, as it
was for Rousseau, we have, meanwhile, to be satisfied with relative
truths. In sober fact, we are a poor set of mortals at best, ever in
dread before the face of even a relative truth, lest it should devour
ourselves and our petty little preconceptions along with us. As for an
absolute truth, most of us are as incapable of seeing it as of reaching
the moon on a bicycle. Firstly, because absolute truth is as immovable
as the mountain of Mahomet, which refused to disturb itself for the
prophet, so that he had to go to it himself. And we have to follow his
example if we would approach it even at a distance. Secondly, because
the kingdom of absolute truth is not of this world, while we are too
much of it. And thirdly, because notwithstanding that in the poet’s
fancy man is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... the abstract</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all perfection, which the workmanship</div>
      <div class='line'>Of heaven hath modelled....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c038'>in reality he is a sorry bundle of anomalies and paradoxes, an empty
wind bag inflated with his own importance, with contradictory and easily
influenced opinions. He is at once an arrogant and a weak creature,
which, though in constant dread of some authority, terrestrial or celestial,
will yet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... like an angry ape,</div>
      <div class='line'>Play such fantastic tricks before high Heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>As make the angels weep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>Now, since truth is a multifaced jewel, the facets of which it is impossible
to perceive all at once; and since, again, no two men, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>anxious to discern truth, can see even one of those facets alike, what can
be done to help them to perceive it? As physical man, limited and
trammelled from every side by illusions, cannot reach truth by the light
of his terrestrial perceptions, we say—develop in you the <em>inner</em> knowledge.
From the time when the Delphic oracle said to the enquirer
“Man, know thyself,” no greater or more important truth was ever taught.
Without such perception, man will remain ever blind to even many a
relative, let alone absolute, truth. Man has to <em>know himself</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, acquire
the <em>inner</em> perceptions which never deceive, before he can master any
absolute truth. Absolute truth is <em>the symbol of Eternity</em>, and no <em>finite</em> mind
can ever grasp the eternal, hence, no truth in its fulness can ever dawn
upon it. To reach the state during which man sees and senses it, we have
to paralyze the senses of the external man of clay. This is a difficult
task, we may be told, and most people will, at this rate, prefer to remain
satisfied with relative truths, no doubt. But to approach even terrestrial
truths requires, first of all, <em>love of truth for its own sake</em>, for otherwise no
recognition of it will follow. And who loves truth in this age for its
own sake? How many of us are prepared to search for, accept, and
carry it out, in the midst of a society in which anything that would
achieve success <em>has to be built on appearances, not on reality, on self-assertion,
not on intrinsic value</em>? We are fully aware of the difficulties
in the way of receiving truth. The fair heavenly maiden descends
only on a (to her) congenial soil—the soil of an impartial, unprejudiced
mind, illuminated by pure Spiritual Consciousness; and both are truly
rare dwellers in civilized lands. In our century of steam and electricity,
when man lives at a maddening speed that leaves him barely time for
reflection, he allows himself usually to be drifted down from cradle to
grave, nailed to the Procrustean bed of custom and conventionality. Now
conventionality—pure and simple—is a congenital <span class='fss'>LIE</span>, as it is in every
case a “<em>simulation</em> of feelings according to a received standard” (F. W.
Robertson’s definition); and where there is any simulation <em>there cannot be
any truth</em>. How profound the remark made by Byron, that “truth is a
gem that is found at a great depth; whilst on the surface of this world
all things are weighed <em>by the false scales of custom</em>,” is best known to
those who are forced to live in the stifling atmosphere of such social
conventionalism, and who, even when willing and anxious to learn, dare
not accept the truths they long for, for fear of the ferocious Moloch
called Society.</p>

<p class='c028'>Look around you, reader; study the accounts given by world-known
travellers, recall the joint observations of literary thinkers, the data of
science and of statistics. Draw the picture of modern society, of
modern politics, of modern religion and modern life in general before
your mind’s eye. Remember the ways and customs of every cultured
race and nation under the sun. Observe the doings and the moral
attitude of people in the civilized centres of Europe, America, and even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>of the far East and the colonies, everywhere where the white man has
carried the “benefits” of so-called civilization. And now, having passed
in review all this, pause and reflect, and then name, <em>if you can</em>, that
blessed <em>Eldorado</em>, that exceptional spot on the globe, <em>where</em> <span class='fss'>TRUTH</span> <em>is
the honoured guest, and</em> <span class='sc'>Lie</span> <em>and</em> <span class='sc'>Sham</span> <em>the ostracised outcasts</em>? <span class='sc'>You
cannot.</span> Nor can any one else, unless he is prepared and determined
to add his mite to the mass of falsehood that reigns supreme in every
department of national and social life. “Truth!” cried Carlyle, “truth,
though the heavens crush me for following her, no falsehood, though a
whole celestial Lubberland were the prize of Apostasy.” Noble words,
these. But how many think, and how many will <em>dare</em> to speak as
Carlyle did, in our nineteenth century day? Does not the gigantic
appalling majority prefer to a man the “paradise of Do-nothings,” the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>pays de Cocagne</i></span> of heartless selfishness? It is this majority that recoils
terror-stricken before the most shadowy outline of every new and unpopular
truth, out of mere cowardly fear, lest Mrs. Harris should denounce,
and Mrs. Grundy condemn, its converts to the torture of being rent
piecemeal by her murderous tongue.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Selfishness</span>, the first-born of Ignorance, and the fruit of the teaching
which asserts that for every newly-born infant a new soul, <em>separate
and distinct</em> from the Universal Soul, is “created”—this Selfishness is
the impassable wall between the <em>personal</em> Self and Truth. It is the
prolific mother of all human vices. <em>Lie</em> being born out of the necessity
for dissembling, and <em>Hypocrisy</em> out of the desire to mask <em>Lie</em>. It is the
fungus growing and strengthening with age in every human heart in
which it has devoured all better feelings. Selfishness kills every noble
impulse in our natures, and is the one deity, fearing no faithlessness or
desertion from its votaries. Hence, we see it reign supreme in the world
and in so-called fashionable society. As a result, we live, and move, and
have our being in this god of darkness under his trinitarian aspect of
Sham, Humbug, and Falsehood, called <span class='sc'>Respectability</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Is this Truth and Fact, or is it slander? Turn whichever way you
will, and you find, from the top of the social ladder to the bottom, deceit
and hypocrisy at work for dear Self’s sake, in every nation as in every
individual. But nations, by tacit Agreement, have decided that selfish
motives in politics shall be called “noble national aspiration,
patriotism,” etc.; and the citizen views it in his family circle as “domestic
virtue.” Nevertheless, Selfishness, whether it breeds desire for aggrandizement
of territory, or competition in commerce at the expense of one’s
neighbour, can never be regarded as a virtue. We see smooth-tongued
<span class='sc'>Deceit</span> and <span class='sc'>Brute Force</span>—the <em>Jachin</em> and <em>Boaz</em> of every International
Temple of Solomon—called Diplomacy, and we call it by its right name.
Because the diplomat bows low before these two pillars of national glory
and politics, and puts their masonic symbolism “in (cunning) strength
shall this my house be established” into daily practice; <i>i.e.</i>, gets by deceit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>what he cannot obtain by force—shall we applaud him? A diplomat’s
qualification—“dexterity or skill in securing advantages“—for one’s
own country at the expense of other countries, can hardly be achieved
by speaking <em>truth</em>, but verily by a wily and deceitful tongue; and, therefore,
<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> calls such action—a <em>living</em>, and an evident <span class='sc'>Lie</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>But it is not in politics alone that custom and selfishness have agreed
to call deceit and lie virtue, and to reward him who lies best with public
statues. Every class of Society lives on <span class='fss'>LIE</span>, and would fall to pieces
without it. Cultured, God-and-law-fearing aristocracy being as fond of
the forbidden fruit as any plebeian, is forced to lie from morn to noon
in order to cover what it is pleased to term its “little peccadillos,” but
which <span class='sc'>Truth</span> regards as gross immorality. Society of the middle
classes is honeycombed with false smiles, false talk, and mutual
treachery. For the majority religion has become a thin tinsel veil thrown
over the corpse of spiritual faith. The master goes to church to
deceive his servants; the starving curate—preaching what he has ceased
to believe in—hood-winks his bishop; the bishop—his God. <em>Dailies</em>,
political and social, might adopt with advantage for their motto Georges
Dandin’s immortal query—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Lequel de nous deux trompe-t-on ici?”</span>—Even
Science, once the anchor of the salvation of Truth, has ceased
to be the temple of <em>naked</em> Fact. Almost to a man the Scientists strive
now only to force upon their colleagues and the public the acceptance
of some personal hobby, of some new-fangled theory, which will shed
lustre on their name and fame. A Scientist is as ready to suppress
damaging evidence against a current scientific hypothesis in our times,
as a missionary in heathen-land, or a preacher at home, to persuade his
congregation that modern geology is a lie, and evolution but vanity and
vexation of spirit.</p>

<p class='c028'>Such is the actual state of things in 1888 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and yet we are taken
to task by certain papers for seeing this year in more than gloomy
colours!</p>

<p class='c028'>Lie has spread to such extent—supported as it is by custom and
conventionalities—that even chronology forces people to lie. The
suffixes <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> and <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> used after the dates of the year by Jew and
Heathen, in European and even Asiatic lands, by the Materialist and
the Agnostic as much as by the Christian, at home, are—a <em>lie</em> used to
sanction another <span class='fss'>LIE</span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Where then is even relative truth to be found? If, so far back as
the century of Democritus, she appeared to him under the form of a
goddess lying at the very bottom of a well, so deep that it gave but little
hope for her release; under the present circumstances we have a certain
right to believe her hidden, at least, as far off as the ever invisible
<em>dark</em> side of the moon. This is why, perhaps, all the votaries of hidden
truths are forthwith set down as lunatics. However it may be, in no
case and under no threat shall <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> be ever forced into pandering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>to any universally and tacitly recognised, and as universally practised
lie, but will hold to fact, pure and simple, trying to proclaim truth
whensoever found, and under no cowardly mask. Bigotry and intolerance
may be regarded as orthodox and sound policy, and the encouraging of
social prejudices and personal hobbies at the cost of truth, as a wise
course to pursue in order to secure success for a publication. Let it be
so. The Editors of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> are Theosophists, and their motto is
chosen: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Vera pro gratiis</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>They are quite aware that <span class='sc'>Lucifer’s</span> libations and sacrifices to the
goddess Truth do not send a sweet savoury smoke into the noses of the
lords of the press, nor does the bright “Son of the Morning” smell sweet
in their nostrils. He is ignored when not abused as—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>veritas odium paret</i></span>.
Even his friends are beginning to find fault with him. They cannot see <em>why
it should not be a purely Theosophical magazine</em>, in other words, why it
refuses to be dogmatic and bigoted. Instead of devoting every inch of
space to theosophical and occult teachings, it opens its pages “to the
publication of the most grotesquely heterogeneous elements and conflicting
doctrines.” This is the chief accusation, to which we answer—why
not? Theosophy is divine knowledge, and knowledge is truth;
every <em>true</em> fact, every sincere word are thus part and parcel of Theosophy.
One who is skilled in divine alchemy, or even approximately
blessed with the gift of the perception of truth, will find and extract it
from an erroneous as much as from a correct statement. However
small the particle of gold lost in a ton of rubbish, it is the noble metal
still, and worthy of being dug out even at the price of some extra
trouble. As has been said, it is often as useful to know what a
thing <em>is not</em>, as to learn what it <em>is</em>. The average reader can hardly hope
to find any fact in a sectarian publication under all its aspects, <em>pro</em> and
<em>con</em>, for either one way or the other its presentation is sure to be
biassed, and the scales helped to incline to that side to which its
editor’s special policy is directed. A Theosophical magazine is thus,
perhaps, the only publication where one may hope to find, at any rate,
the unbiassed, if still only approximate truth and fact. Naked truth
is reflected in <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> under its many aspects, for no philosophical or
religious views are excluded from its pages. And, as every philosophy
and religion, however incomplete, unsatisfactory, and even foolish some
may be occasionally, must be based on a truth and fact of some kind,
the reader has thus the opportunity of comparing, analysing, and
choosing from the several philosophies discussed therein. <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>
offers as many facets of the One universal jewel as its limited space
will permit, and says to its readers: “Choose you this day whom ye will
serve: whether the gods that were on the other side of the flood
which submerged man’s reasoning powers and divine knowledge, or the
gods of the Amorites of <em>custom</em> and <em>social falsehood</em>, or again, the
Lord of (the highest) Self—the bright destroyer of the dark power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>illusion?” Surely it is that philosophy that tends to diminish,
instead of adding to, the sum of human misery, which is the best.</p>

<p class='c028'>At all events, the choice is there, and for this purpose only have we
opened our pages to every kind of contributors. Therefore do you find
in them the views of a Christian clergyman who believes in his God
and Christ, but rejects the wicked interpretations and the enforced
dogmas of his ambitious proud Church, along with the doctrines of the
Hylo-Idealist, who denies God, soul, and immortality, and believes in
nought save himself. The rankest Materialists will find hospitality in
our journal; aye, even those who have not scrupled to fill pages of it
with sneers and personal remarks upon ourselves, and abuse of the
doctrines of Theosophy, so dear to us. When a journal of <em>free thought</em>,
conducted by an Atheist, inserts an article by a Mystic or Theosophist in
praise of his occult views and the mystery of Parabrahmam, and passes
on it only a few casual remarks, then shall we say <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> has found a
rival. When a Christian periodical or missionary organ accepts an
article from the pen of a free-thinker deriding belief in Adam and his
rib, and passes criticism on Christianity—its editor’s faith—in meek
silence, then it will have become worthy of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, and may be said
truly to have reached that degree of tolerance when it may be placed
on a level with any Theosophical publication.</p>

<p class='c028'>But so long as none of these organs do something of the kind, they are
all sectarian, bigoted, intolerant, and can never have an idea of truth and
justice. They may throw innuendoes against <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> and its editors,
they cannot affect either. In fact, the editors of that magazine feel proud
of such criticism and accusations, as they are witnesses to the absolute
absence of bigotry, or arrogance of any kind in theosophy, the result of
the divine beauty of the doctrines it preaches. For, as said, Theosophy
allows a hearing and a fair chance to all. It deems no views—if sincere—entirely
destitute of truth. It respects thinking men, to whatever
class of thought they may belong. Ever ready to oppose ideas and
views which can only create confusion without benefiting philosophy,
it leaves their expounders personally to believe in whatever they please,
and does justice to their ideas when they are good. Indeed, the conclusions
or deductions of a philosophic writer may be entirely opposed
to our views and the teachings we expound; yet, his premises and
statements of facts may be quite correct, and other people may profit
by the adverse philosophy, even if we ourselves reject it, believing we
have something higher and still nearer to the truth. In any case, our
profession of faith is now made plain, and all that is said in the foregoing
pages both justifies and explains our editorial policy.</p>

<p class='c028'>To sum up the idea, with regard to absolute and relative truth,
we can only repeat what we said before. <em>Outside a certain highly
spiritual and elevated state of mind, during which Man is at one with
the</em> <span class='sc'>Universal Mind</span>—<em>he can get nought on earth but relative truth,</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span><em>or truths, from whatsoever philosophy or religion</em>. Were even the goddess
who dwells at the bottom of the well to issue from her place of confinement,
she could give man no more than he can assimilate. Meanwhile,
every one can sit near that well—the name of which is
<span class='sc'>Knowledge</span>—and gaze into its depths in the hope of seeing Truth’s
fair image reflected, at least, on the dark waters. This, however, as
remarked by Richter, presents a certain danger. Some truth, to be
sure, may be occasionally reflected as in a mirror on the spot we gaze
upon, and thus reward the patient student. But, adds the German
thinker, “I have heard that some philosophers in seeking for Truth, to
pay homage to her, have seen their own image in the water and adored
it instead.”...</p>

<p class='c028'>It is to avoid such a calamity—one that has befallen every founder of
a religious or philosophical school—that the editors are studiously careful
not to offer the reader only those truths which they find reflected in their
own personal brains. They offer the public a wide choice, and refuse to
show bigotry and intolerance, which are the chief landmarks on the path
of Sectarianism. But, while leaving the widest margin possible for comparison,
our opponents cannot hope to find <em>their faces</em> reflected on the
clear waters of our <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, without remarks or just criticism upon the
most prominent features thereof, if in contrast with theosophical views.</p>

<p class='c028'>This, however, only within the cover of the public magazine, and so
far as regards the merely intellectual aspect of philosophical truths.
Concerning the deeper spiritual, and one may almost say religious,
beliefs, no true Theosophist ought to degrade these by subjecting them to
public discussion, but ought rather to treasure and hide them deep within
the sanctuary of his innermost soul. Such beliefs and doctrines should
never be rashly given out, as they risk unavoidable profanation by the
rough handling of the indifferent and the critical. Nor ought they to be
embodied in any publication except as hypotheses offered to the consideration
of the thinking portion of the public. Theosophical truths,
when they transcend a certain limit of speculation, had better remain
concealed from public view, for the “evidence of things not seen” is no
evidence save to him who sees, hears, and senses it. It is not to be
dragged outside the “Holy of Holies,” the temple of the impersonal
divine <em>Ego</em>, or the indwelling <span class='sc'>Self</span>. For, while every fact outside <em>its</em>
perception can, as we have shown, be, at best, only a relative truth,
a ray from the absolute truth can reflect itself only in the pure mirror of
its own flame—our highest <span class='sc'>Spiritual Consciousness</span>. And how can
the darkness (of illusion) comprehend the <span class='fss'>LIGHT</span> that shineth in it?</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>In the early days of Israel’s history, whilst Israel was struggling to
be a nation and a kingdom, there was a people called the
Ammonites, who were making war upon the Israelites.</p>

<p class='c028'>And we are told that the Israelites, in great distress and fear, went
out of their country, into the land of Tob, to find a man named Jephthah,
who was a man of mighty valour, in order to persuade him to return
with them, and be the captain and leader of their army, to fight against,
and save them from the Ammonites.</p>

<p class='c028'>Now this man Jephthah was himself an Israelite by birth, but because
his mother had not been legally married to his father, Gilead, the sons
of Gilead’s lawful wife conspired together to drive him from his
hearth, home, and country, as a disgrace to the family and to Israel;
but the true reason was that they were envious and jealous of him, in
like manner as the brethren of Joseph who had previously conspired
against him.</p>

<p class='c028'>For Jephthah himself was wholly innocent of having done anything
to disgrace either the family or the nation. And therefore, in common
justice, he ought not to have been made to suffer merely for the form
and manner of his birth; over which neither Jephthah nor any of us
have any control, either as to the time, when, or the manner, in which we
should be born. But although Jephthah was despised and cast out as a
dog, in the days of Israel’s prosperity, yet in the day of Israel’s adversity
and weakness, Israel no longer allowed any mean and petty distinctions
to prevent her from recognising the noble character of Jephthah, and
she entreated him to forget past ill-usage, and return to be her captain
and leader to save her from the Ammonites.</p>

<p class='c028'>And as this proposal of Israel afforded Jephthah the long wished-for
opportunity of returning to his country, and of establishing an <a id='corr434.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hononrable'>honourable</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_434.29'><ins class='correction' title='hononrable'>honourable</ins></a></span>
reputation, <em>therefore</em> he was not only ready to forget and forgive
the insults and injuries which he had received in the past from his
brethren, but he was also ready to return with them, and share their
troubles and dangers, even to sacrificing his life, if need be, in order to
save their lives and property.</p>

<p class='c028'>Jephthah was the more willing to return and make this sacrifice because
he had a daughter, an only daughter and child; and she was all
the world to him, as he was to her; “for beside her he had neither son
nor daughter,” and she had patiently and willingly suffered with him,
and borne all his sorrows as her own.</p>

<p class='c028'>But imagine the horror of Jephthah, after having saved the lives and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>property of his brethren and countrymen by risking his own life, at being
then required, by these very brethren and countrymen, to shed the blood
of his only child! Immediately after the war was over, Jephthah was
required to sacrifice his daughter as a burnt offering to the Lord of
Battles, for having assisted Israel to overcome the Ammonites; and so
great was the love of this heroine for her father, and for everything
that concerned his honour and glory, that she willingly consented to be
sacrificed as a burnt offering.</p>

<p class='c028'>Can anything be conceived more heartrending and terrible than that
Jephthah should thus be required by these very brethren and countrymen
whom he had saved, to shed the blood of his only child as a sacrifice,
in acknowledgment that he owed his victory to miraculous assistance
and favour, and not to his own skill and valour?</p>

<p class='c028'>What to him was the deliverance either of Israel or of his brethren
(who had cared naught for him), if they now required him to sacrifice
the only being in the world that he loved, and that loved him, and who
was therefore all the world to him?</p>

<p class='c028'>It is true that Jephthah had made a foolish and rash vow, in the mad
excitement of the moment before going into battle, that if he came out
of the battle victorious, he would sacrifice, as a burnt offering to the
Lord, the first thing that came to meet him from his house as he
returned from the battle; but when the first person that met Jephthah
was his only daughter, <em>what could that Deity be, which accepted as a
sacrifice the blood of this child?</em> What could the religion of Jephthah’s
brethren and countrymen be, that allowed and required him to commit
such an evil deed?</p>

<p class='c028'>For if Jephthah had saved his brethren and countrymen from their
enemies, could they not now save Jephthah from shedding the blood of
his daughter as a sacrifice, in the name of religion, <em>when</em> the very deed
itself proclaimed the religion, and their conception both of religion and
of the Deity, to be evil? And if his brethren and countrymen
would not save his daughter, but even required him to fulfil his vow,
could not Jephthah save himself and his child by refusing to commit
this evil deed? But if, in order to save his own blood from being shed
as a blasphemer for an atonement, Jephthah had to flee from the
country as an outcast and a criminal, whither could he flee to, that
would make life worth keeping? For surely the world would be no
desirable place for an honest man to live in, if he had to live at enmity
with men both at home and abroad, because he had made a rash and
foolish vow, which no Deity worthy of being worshipped could or would
require him to perform?</p>

<p class='c028'>Because under such a sanguinary conception of religion, and of the
Deity, there was no remission, or redemption either, with, or without,
the shedding of blood. If Jephthah refused to shed the blood of his
daughter, then both his own and his daughter’s would be shed by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>brethren and countrymen, whilst if Jephthah shed the blood of his
daughter, as a sacrifice to save his own, what remission or redemption
was there in this? None!</p>

<p class='c028'>And he cried for a deliverer to save him and his daughter, from this
great trouble. For he had staked his life and his all upon obtaining a
position and reputation for himself and his daughter at home in Israel;
and now, to give up hope of this for ever, and to shed the blood of
his daughter, or again flee as an outcast—what was it but a living death
to Jephthah, either way, whether he remained and sacrificed his
daughter, or fled to save her?</p>

<p class='c028'>But who, in this agonising moment of Jephthah’s trouble, could raise
his voice to demand, in the name of religion, this diabolical sacrifice of
his innocent child?</p>

<p class='c028'>Yes; diabolical. For what spirit, or voice, but that of a devil or fiend
could <em>counsel</em> men to shed the blood of this pure and noble girl? And
where could the devil or fiend be found who would <em>commit</em> the deed
itself?</p>

<p class='c028'>Jephthah is mockingly told that he is the fiend who must sacrifice his
child, as Abraham is said to have offered Isaac. And Jephthah is told
that he has no one to blame but himself, for having made the vow. But
who heard the vow? or who accepted the vow? Who could he, or they
be, who would require the fulfilling of it?<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c013'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>Are they worthy of the name of brethren and countrymen who would
persuade Jephthah <em>to assassinate</em> his daughter, in the name of religion, or
even look on at such an assassination? Would it not be blasphemy to
say that a good Deity required Jephthah to kill his innocent child?
And would not a good Deity release Jephthah from his vow, and forbid
him to sacrifice his daughter, in like manner as the Scriptures teach us
Abraham was forbidden to sacrifice his son Isaac? And if it is said, it
would have been faithless and sinful of Jephthah after returning from
the battle victorious, to have refused the offering of his daughter as a
sacrifice; yet surely to bind Jephthah to break the Sixth Commandment,
and to shed innocent blood in the name of religion, would be
making the Deity that required such a sacrifice to be evil, and His
worshippers to be the doers of evil; and thus Jephthah would be required
to sell himself to the devil.</p>

<p class='c028'>And how could men be other than the doers of evil, and the priests of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>evil, who would counsel Jephthah to commit this evil deed, and be
ready to commit it themselves if he hesitated? How? Whether
Jephthah received any miraculous assistance or not, in the war, yet he
was in no wise bound to surrender his personality and to become an
abject slave to the supposed power that helped him. For Jephthah’s
personal services were needed as an instrument to deliver and save the
Israelites, or his services would not have been asked for. It was also
possible that he might have given certain services, which even a
miraculous power was unable to give—as we read in the Book of Judges
that “Judah could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because
they had chariots of iron.” (Judges i. 19.)<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c013'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>And again, if all the glory of Jephthah’s victory had to be ascribed to
a miraculous power, then likewise all the shame would have to be
ascribed to that power also, for having ordained that Jephthah’s daughter
should be the first person to meet him after the war, to pay <em>the price of
victory</em> to Jephthah, with <em>death to his child</em>—for whom, alone, he coveted
victory.</p>

<p class='c028'>Victory on such terms was defeat and shame, not glory; for surely
such views of religious worship must be the <em><a id='corr437.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>d’evil</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_437.19'><ins class='correction' title='sic'>d’evil</ins></a></span></em> worship which the
Psalmist speaks of (Psalm cvi., 37), and not the service or worship of a
good God who would have mercy and <em>not</em> sacrifice, as Abraham learnt
when he went out of the Philistine city into the wilderness, and communed
with God alone on Mount Moriah.</p>

<p class='c028'>But it was one thing for a single individual like Abraham, at the
close of a long life, to acquire the knowledge “that God would have
mercy and not sacrifice”; and quite another thing for a Town, a City, a
Nation, or the World, to have acquired this knowledge in its infancy; as
even Abraham only acquired this knowledge by going out of the city
into the wilderness, and communing alone with God.</p>

<p class='c028'>We can well understand how impossible it would have been for
Abraham even to have attempted, on his return from the mountain, to
teach the Philistines the faith or gospel (that God would have mercy
and not sacrifice), from the very fact that when Jesus Christ came <em>into
the world</em> to teach the faith or gospel, which Abraham had gone <em>out of
the world</em> to learn, Jesus was condemned by Caiaphas to be crucified
with malefactors, as a blasphemer. And to this very day this doctrine
of the power of Caiaphas, the adversary of Jesus, continues to be taught
as the doctrine of the Church, which it is necessary to believe in order
to obtain the blessing of the Church here and of God hereafter.</p>

<p class='c028'>Therefore it is manifestly evident that after Abraham had acquired
the knowledge that God would have mercy and not sacrifice, yet he
could not publish it, but could only lay it up in his heart as a secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>treasure, to be disclosed in the distant future, which in the vision of his
mind he saw. Meanwhile he prayed that the Lord would raise up
messengers and stewards to prepare the world to receive this faith or
gospel, because of its being too Herculean a task for any one person to
alter suddenly the religion of a people.</p>

<p class='c028'>For whilst priests continued to teach, and the people to believe that
sacrifices of human beings were acceptable to God, how was the man
who dared (suddenly and without the cloak of a parable) to reveal and
publish the contrary, to escape being himself slain as a blasphemer, whose
blood it would be doing God service to shed for an atonement? And
until the world was sufficiently educated to declare the generation of
him who should be unjustly slain (Isaiah liii.), it could only be like
throwing pearls to swine for such an one to attempt the task.</p>

<p class='c028'>Then from whence, and from whom could Jephthah, who had saved
others, now look for the salvation of his daughter, or of himself, if he
refused to sacrifice that daughter?</p>

<p class='c028'>And, in the anguish of his soul, Jephthah rent his clothes, and bemoaned
his trouble, whilst his daughter fled to the mountains to pour
out the sorrow of her soul, during the few short days she had yet to live.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is true that, in order to save her father from the cruel pain of
assassinating his devoted child, the noble girl may have voluntarily leapt
into the sulphurous flames on the burning altar; just as the noble
Roman soldier Curtius on his horse leapt down into the dark and awful
volcanic gulf as a sacrifice to save his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the more heroic and divine these persons were, the more
demoniacal and diabolical must be the religion of those persons who
required them thus to suffer.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c013'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>It is true that the priests of such a religion may have believed in it
themselves, and may have been ready to sacrifice their own sons and
daughters in like manner; but that in no wise lessens the crime, but on
the contrary it intensifies it a hundred fold. How were the people to
be saved from a religion, of which the priests themselves needed to be
saved, whilst the priests had the sole education of the people from
infancy upwards, as well as the Chief power in the State to make and
unmake its laws, even to making and unmaking its kings?</p>

<p class='c028'>Whilst the priests and rulers of the church taught such a cruel religion,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c013'><sup>[151]</sup></a>
would not the people and priests need a Mediator to deliver and save
them from practising it?</p>

<p class='c028'>If He who mediated to deliver and save us was Himself condemned
to be slain, and crucified with thieves as a blasphemer whose blood
ought to be shed for an Atonement, what hope of salvation can there be
for the world from such a Religion, until the people not only uplift the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>Crucified Jesus as having been no blasphemer, but also expose the
doctrine to be evil and false which is quoted as an authority for requiring
the blood of “the Just one” to be shed for an Atonement? And if it
is said that we have no longer women brought like Jephthah’s daughter
to be assassinated and burnt as a sacrifice, or noble men condemned to
be burnt as heretics, yet we have to the present day noble men and
women condemned by the Church as evil (to be accursed here and
damned hereafter), simply and solely because they refuse to believe this
evil doctrine of Atonement, which is oftentimes such a burden to their
soul (either to accept or reject) that they are driven to the very verge of
madness.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is no uncommon thing to hear priests revile even our Queen as
being no true Christian, simply because they suppose she does not
believe in this evil doctrine of atonement, which is the doctrine of
Caiaphas, the enemy of Christ, and not Christ’s doctrine, teaching, or
gospel.</p>

<p class='c028'>Should not such scriptural stories as these of the assassination of
Jephthah’s noble daughter, of the crucifixion of Jesus, and the spilling
of the blood of a whole host of martyrs, awaken men who have
slumbered to rise, to hear, to see, to speak, and run to save the world
from having to believe in this sanguinary doctrine, which is a stumbling-block
to the Jews, foolishness to the world, and a mystery even to the
teachers of it. This doctrine of Atonement can not be reconciled as
either good or true; and therefore it is the cause of all progress being
prevented so far as the world is dependent on the Church for progress.</p>

<p class='c028'>Yet the man who doubts or denies the goodness of this doctrine is
branded by the Church, to the present day, as a Sceptic and Atheist,
whom all sound Churchmen should avoid. And for sixteen centuries
the Church used its sovereign power to condemn those who rejected its
doctrine of Atonement as criminals, whom it would be doing God
service to burn as heretics; and the Church is only prevented from
doing so now <em>because</em> (to its great regret) it has no longer the power which
it formerly had in the days of “the Inquisition.” The doctrine remains
the same still, and therefore the people owe it, as a duty to the long
roll of martyrs, to expose it. For it has been the cause of much evil,
and even to this day it assassinates the souls of noble men and women,
who incarcerate themselves in monasteries and nunneries in the vain
attempt to attain a sound belief in it.</p>

<p class='c028'>But when the Church is willing to allow (what it has refused to the
present day) liberty in the pulpit for explaining the mystery and
translating the truth of a “Crucified Christ,” then it will be seen that
the truth is not only a light to the Gentiles, but also the glory of
Israel; and the truth shall make us free.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c013'><sup>[152]</sup></a> (John viii., 32.)</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>LUNIOLATRY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>A friend has just informed me of the fact that when President
Cleveland was making his recent tour through the States an
old negro presented him with <em>the left hind foot of a grave-yard
rabbit, which had been killed in the dark of the moon</em>. In making
his present the negro said he had sent it because he desired the reelection
of President Cleveland. “<em>Tell him to preserve it carefully,
and that as long as he keeps it he will always get there.</em>”</p>

<p class='c028'>The friend whom I speak of had just been reading a lecture of mine
on “Luniolatry,” in which the imagery and significance of the hare and
rabbit in the moon were spoken of all too briefly, and he wishes to
know if I can interpret the meaning of the negro’s gift. I guess so.
As previously explained the hare and the rabbit are both zootypes or
living images of lunar phenomena. A rabbit pounding rice in a mortar
is a Chinese sign of the moon. Swabian children are still forbidden to
make the likeness of a rabbit or hare in shadow on the wall, as it
would be a sin against the moon. The hare in the moon is a well-known
Hindu type of Buddha. It is mythically represented that
Buddha once took the form of a hare on purpose to offer himself as
food for a poor famishing creature, and so the Buddha was translated
in that shape to be eternized as the hare in the moon. That is one
illustration of the way in which the book of external nature was filled
full of mystic meanings, the essence of which escapes altogether in
trying to read such things as historical, no matter whether they are
related of Buddha, Horus, or Jesus. This hare or rabbit in the moon is
a symbol or superstition with various races, Black, Brown, Red, Yellow,
and White. When the meaning was understood it was a symbol; when
the clue is lost it becomes a superstition of the ignorant; thus the
ancient symbolism survives in a state of dotage with the negroes as
well as with the “noble Caucasian.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The frog in the moon was another lunar type. In a Chinese myth—that
is, a symbolic representation—the lunar frog has three legs, like
the Persian ass in the Bundahish. In both cases the three legs stand
for three phases of the moon reckoned at ten days each in a luni-solar
month of thirty days. Now it happens that the rabbit’s period of
gestation is thirty days; and the early races included very curious
observers amongst their naturalists, who had to think in things and
express their thought in gesture-signs and <em>zootypes</em> before there were
such things as printer’s types. Hence the frog that dropped its tail, the
serpent that sloughed its skin, the rabbit with its period of thirty days,
were all symbols of the moon. Enough that the rabbit <em>was</em> a zootype
of the moon, and the rabbit is equal to the hare. Hor-Apollo tells us
that when the Egyptians would denote “an opening,” they delineate a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>hare, because this animal always has its eyes open (B. I. 26). This can
be corroborated in several ways. The name of the hare in Egyptian
is “Un,” which means open, to open, the opener. It was applied
to Osiris, “Un-Nefer,” in his lunar character as the good opener,
otherwise the splendid or glorious hare, because “Nefer” means the
handsome, beautiful, perfect, or glorious. Also the city of Unnut
was that of the hare, “Un,” and this was the metropolis of the
15th Nome of Upper Egypt, which is another mode of identifying
the open-eyed hare with the moon at the full, called the “Eye of
Horus,” and with the woman of the moon who brings her orb to the
full on the 15th day of the month (Egyptian Ritual, ch. lxxx). The
hare was also a symbol of the opening period at puberty, a sign
therefore of being open, unprohibited, or “it is lawful” (Sharpe).
Hence the Namaqua Hottentots would only permit the hare to be
eaten by those who had attained the age of the adult male. The
proverb, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Somnus leporinus</i></span>,” relates to the hare that sleeps with its
eyes open; and in our old English pharmacopœia of the folk-lore or
leech-craft, the brains and eyes of the hare are prescribed as a cure for
somnolency, and a sovereign medicine for making or keeping people
wide-awake. The rabbit equates with the hare, and has the same
symbolical value. Now it is sometimes said that the hare-rabbit is of
both sexes. So the moon was both male and female in accordance with
the dual lunation. The new moon with the horns of the bull or the
long ears of the ass, the rabbit, or hare was considered to be male.
The dark lunation or hinder part was female. In the ancient symbolism
the front or fore-part is masculine, the hinder-part or the tail is
feminine. The two were head and tail in the earliest coinage as well
as on the latest coins. In Egypt the South was front and is male;
the North was the hinder-part and is female. Hence the old Typhon
of the Northern part was denoted by the tail-piece, and it follows that
Satan with the long tail is of feminine origin, and so the devil was
female from the first. The same symbolism was applied to the moon.
In the light half it was the male moon, in the dark half female. The
new moon was the Lord of Light, the Increaser, the sign of new life,
of saving and healing. The new moon was the messenger of
immortality to men in the form of the hare or the rabbit. The
waning moon represented the devil of darkness, the Typhonian power
that said to men “even as I die and do not rise again so will it be
with you.” Offerings were made to the new moon. When the moon
was at the full the Egyptians sacrificed a black pig to Osiris. This
represented Typhon, his conquered enemy. But in the dark half of
the lunation Typhon had the upper hand when he tore Osiris into
fourteen parts during the fourteen nights of his supremacy. The
lunar zootype then is male in front, and female in the hinder-part of the
animal. In the hieroglyphics the khepsh-leg or hind-quarter is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>ideographic type of Typhon, the evil power personified. Further, the
left side is female and Typhonian; the right is male. Ergo, <em>the left
hind leg of the grave-yard animal that was killed in the dark of the
moon</em>, stood for the hind (or last) quarter of the moon; literally the end
of it. And if the negro laid hold of that rabbit’s foot the right way, we
can read the symbol that he probably did not understand, although
he knew the rabbit’s hind foot was a good fetish. It shows the
survival of <em>intended</em> symbolism, which represents some sort of victory
over the power of darkness analogous to taking the brush of the fox
(another Typhonian animal) after it has been hunted to death. This
was the last leg that the devil of darkness had to stand on, and so it was
a trophy snatched from the Typhonian power to be worn in triumph as
a token of good luck, of repetition or renewal, thence a second term.</p>

<p class='c028'>It would be a sort of equivalent for taking the scalp of Satan, who
could only be typified by the tail or hinder leg. The gift was tantamount
to wishing “<em>A Happy New Moon to You!</em>” expressed in the
language of symbolism, which was acted instead of being spoken. The
negroes consider this particular talisman bequeathed by “<em>Brer Rabbit</em>”
represents all the virtues and powers of renewal that are popularly
attributed to the New Moon. But do not let me be misunderstood by
those who know that in the Negro Märchen the rabbit is the good one
of the typical two, and that the fox plays the Typhonian part. The
rabbit or hare of the moon may be pourtrayed in two characters or in
one of two. In both he is the hero, the Lord of Light and conqueror
of the Power of Darkness, the rabbit, so to say, that rises again from
the graveyard in or as the New Moon. The figure of the hind quarter
and latter end of the dying moon is thus a type of the conquered
Typhon, but the magical influence depends upon its being also a type
of the conqueror, the rabbit of the resurrection or the New Moon. It
is a curious coincidence that the luckiest of all Lucky Horse-Shoes in
England is one that has been cast off the <em>left hind foot</em> of a Mare.</p>

<p class='c028'>Lastly, this hind leg of the lunar rabbit is a fellow-type with the leg
of pig that is still eaten in England on Easter Monday, which is a
survival of the ancient sacrifice of the pig Typhon, in the solar or
annual reckoning, as pourtrayed in the planisphere of Denderah, where
we see the god Khunsu offering the pig by the leg in the disc of the full
moon. It must have been a potent fetish long ages ago in Africa, and
a medicine of great power according to the primitive mysteries of the
dark land. It may be surmised that much of this fetishtic typology is
still extant amongst the negroes in the United States, and it is to be
hoped that the Bureau of Ethnology at Washington, which has done,
and is doing, such good work under the direction of Major J. W. Powell
in collecting and preserving the relics of the Red Men, will extend the
range of its researches to the black race in America, and not leave those
matters to irresponsible story-tellers.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<p class='c035'>It was the day of the Princess Fleta’s wedding and the whole city
was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en fête</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary Estanol paced the streets wildly, like a creature distracted.
He had never seen her face since the day he returned from the
secret monastery. He could not trust himself to go near her. He felt
that the savage in him must kill, must destroy, if too much provocation
were given him.</p>

<p class='c028'>He held this savage in check as well as he could. He would not trust
himself under the same roof with the woman he loved as he loved
nothing else in life, and who had given him her love while she gave
herself to another man. Herself! How much that meant Hilary
seemed only now to know, now that he heard her marriage bells ringing,
now that she was absolutely given. Yes, she had given herself away to
another man. Was it possible? Hilary stood still now and again in the
midst of the crowded street trying to remember the words she had said
to him in that wood in the early morn when she had accepted his love.
What had she taken from him then? He had never been the same since.
His heart lay cold, and chill, and dull within him save when her smile or
its memory woke him to life and joy. Were these gone for ever?
Impossible. He was still young—a mere boy. She could not have stolen
so much from him! No—he had the first right—he would be her lover
still and always, to whoever else she gave herself in name. This was the
point of thought to which Hilary perpetually returned. Undoubtedly she
was his, and he would claim her. But obscured and excited as his mind
was he had sufficient intelligence to know that his must be a secret claim
even though it stood before all others. He could not go and claim her
at the altar, for she had not given him any right to. What she had said
was, “Take from me what you can.” Well, he could not make her his
wife. He could not marry a royal Princess. She was not of his class.
This being so, what could he hope for? Nothing—and yet he had her
love—yes, the last kind touch of her hand, the last sweet smile on her
lips, were still with him, and drove his blood rioting through his veins.</p>

<p class='c028'>At last the procession is coming—the soldiers have already cleared the
way and with their horses keep back the crowd. Hilary stands now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>still as a carven figure, watching only for one face. He sees it suddenly—ah!
so beautiful, so supremely beautiful, so mysterious—and everything
in Heaven and earth becomes invisible, non-existent, save that one dear
face. A voice rang out on the air, clear, shrill, above all other voices.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta! Fleta! My love! my love!”</p>

<p class='c028'>What a cry! It penetrated to Fleta’s ears; it reached the ears of her
bridegroom.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the church, amid the pomp and ceremony, and the crowd of great
people, Otto did a thing which made those near him stare. He went to
meet his bride and touched her hand.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta,” he said, “that voice was the voice of one who loves you.
What answer do you make to it?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta put her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c028'>“That is my answer,” she said.</p>

<p class='c028'>And so they stepped up the broad low steps to the altar. None heard
what had been said except the king.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta’s father was strangely unlike herself. He was a rugged, morose,
sombre man, ill-disposed towards all humanity, as it would seem, save
those few who held the key to his nature. Of these, his daughter was
one; some said she was the only one. Others said her power lay in the
fact that she was not his daughter, but a child of other parents
altogether than those reputed to be hers; and that a State secret was
involved in the mystery of her birth.</p>

<p class='c028'>At all events, it was seldom indeed that the king interfered with
Fleta. But he did so now, at this moment, with all the eyes of the
Court upon them.</p>

<p class='c028'>He spoke low into her ear, he stood beside her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta,” he said, “is this marriage right?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta turned on him a face so full of torture, of deathly pain, that he
uttered an ejaculation of horror.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Say no word, my father,” she said, “it is right.”</p>

<p class='c028'>And then she turned her head again, and fixed her glorious eyes on
Otto.</p>

<p class='c028'>What a strangely beautiful bride she was! She was dressed with
extraordinary simplicity; her robe had been arranged by her own hands
in long, soft lines that fell from her neck to her feet, and a long train lay
on the ground behind her, but it was undecked by any lace or flowers.
No flowers were in her hair, no jewels on her neck. Never had a princess
been dressed so simply, a princess who was to be a queen. The Court
ladies stared in amazement. But they knew well that there was a grace
so supreme, a dignity so lofty, in this royal girl, that however simple
her dress she outshone them all, and would outshine any woman who
stood beside her.</p>

<p class='c028'>No one heard any of what passed between the three chief actors in
this scene; yet everyone was aware that there was something unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>in it. There was an atmosphere of mystery, of excitement, of strangeness.
And yet what else would be possible where the Princess Fleta
was concerned? In her father’s Court she was looked upon as a wild,
capricious, imperious creature whose will none could resist. None
would have wondered had they believed her carriage to have passed
over the body of an accepted lover, now thrown aside and discarded.
So did these people interpret the character of Fleta. Otto knew this,
felt it, understood it; knew that those creatures of intrigue and pleasure
would have thought her far less worthy had they judged her character
more nearly as he did. To him she was pure, stainless, unattainable;
virgin in soul and thought. This he said to her when, on
leaving the cathedral, they entered a carriage together and alone.
They had together passed through crowds of congratulators, nobles,
great ladies, diplomats from different parts of Europe. They had bowed
and smiled, and answered courteously the words addressed to them.
And yet how far away were their thoughts all the while! They
neither of them knew who they had met, who they had spoken to. All
was lost in one absorbing thought. But it was not the same thought.
No, indeed, their minds were separated widely as the poles.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta was filled with the sense of a great purpose. This marriage was
but the first step in a giant programme. Her thoughts had flown now
from this first step and were dwelling on the end, the fulfilment; as an
artist when he draws his first sketch sees in his own mind the completed
picture.</p>

<p class='c028'>Otto had but one overwhelming thought; a very simple one, expressed
instantly, in the first words he uttered when they were
alone:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta, you did not fancy that I doubted you? I never meant that!
And yet it seemed as if there was reproach in your eyes! No, Fleta,
never that. But the cry was so terrible—it cut my heart. You did not
fancy I meant any doubt?—assure me, Fleta!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No, I did not,” replied Fleta quietly. “You know whose voice
it was.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No—it was unrecognisable—it was nothing but a cry of torture.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah! but I knew it,” said Fleta. “It was Hilary Estanol who cried
out my name.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“He said ‘Fleta, my love, my love,’” added Otto. “Is he that?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” said Fleta unmoved, indeed strangely calm. “He is. More,
Otto; he has loved me long centuries ago, when this world wore a
different face. When the very surface of the earth was savage and
untaught so were we. And then we enacted this same scene. Yes
Alan, we three enacted it before, without this pomp, but with the natural
splendour of savage beauty and undimmed skies. Otto, I sinned then
I expiated my sin. Again and again have I expiated it. Again and
again has Nature punished me for my offence against her. Now at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>I know more, I see more, I understand more. The sin remains. I
desired to take, to have for myself, to be a conqueror. I conquered—I
have conquered since! how often! That has been my expiation:
satiety. But now I will no longer enjoy. I will stand on that error,
that folly, and win from it strength which shall lift me from this
wretched little theatre where we play the same dramas for ever through
the fond weariness of recurring lives.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Otto had drawn back from her, and gazed intently upon her as she
spoke, passion and vehemence gradually entering her low voice. As she
ceased he passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta,” he said, “is this some spell of yours upon me? While you
spoke I saw your face change, and become the face of one familiar to
me, but far, far back! I smelled the intense rich scent of innumerable
fruit blossoms——Fleta, tell me, are you dreaming or speaking fables,
or is this thing true? Have I lived for you before, loved you, served
you, ages back, when the world was young?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” said Fleta.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Ah!” cried Otto suddenly, “I feel it—there is blood on you—blood
on your hand!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta raised her beautiful hand, and looked at it with an infinite
sadness on her face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is so,” she answered. “There is blood on it, and there will be,
until I have got beyond the reign of blood and of death. You held me
down then, Otto; you triumphed by brute force, not knowing that in
me lay a power undreamed of by you—a vital, stirring will. I could
have crushed you. But already I had used my will once, and found the
bitter, unintelligible suffering it produced. I determined to try and
understand Nature before I again used my power. So I submitted to
your tyranny; you learned to love it, and through many lives have
learned to love it more. It has brought you a crown at last, and a little
army of soldiers to defend it for you, and half-a-dozen crafty old
diplomats who want you to keep it, and who think they can make you
do just as their respective monarchs wish. Move your puppets, Otto.
No such kingdom satisfies me. I mean to win my own crown. I will
be a queen of souls, not of bodies; a queen in reality, not in
name.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She seemed to wrap herself in an impenetrable veil of scorn as she
ceased speaking and leaned back in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c028'>Some great emotion was stirring Otto through and through. At
last he spoke; and the man seemed changed—a different being. From
under the gentle manner, the docile, ready air, came struggling up the
fierce spirit of opposition.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You despise the crown you married me for? Is that so? Well, I
will teach you to respect it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>A smile dawned on Fleta’s clouded face and then was gone again in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>a moment. This was all the answer she vouchsafed to the kingly threat.
Otto turned and looked at her steadily.</p>

<p class='c028'>“A magnificent creature,” he said, “beautiful, and with a brain of
steel, and perhaps for all I know, a heart like it. You won a great deal
from me, Fleta, a little while since. Did I not submit to the masquerading
of your mysterious Order? Did I not trust my life to those
treacherous monks of yours, submit to be blindfolded and led into their
haunt by secret ways. For what end? Ivan told me of aspirations, of
ideas, of thoughts, which only sickened my soul and filled me with
shame and despair. For I am a believer in order, in moral rule, in the
government of the world in accordance with the principles of religion.
I told you I was willing to become a member of the order; yes, because
my nature is in sympathy with its avowed tenets. But its secret
doctrines as I have heard them from you, as I have heard them from the
man you call your master, are to me detestable. And it is for the
carrying out of this unholy theory or doctrine that you propose to
surrender your life? No, Fleta; you are now my queen.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes,” said Fleta. “I am now your queen. I know that I have
chosen the lot willingly. You need not again tell me that I have the
crown I purposed to obtain.”</p>

<p class='c028'>At this moment they arrived at the palace. There was yet a weary
mass of ceremony and speaking of polite nothings to be passed through
before there was any chance of their being alone again. Otto relapsed
into the pleasant and kindly manner which was habitual with <a id='corr447.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='him'>him.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_447.27'><ins class='correction' title='him'>him.</ins></a></span>
Fleta fell into one of her abstracted moods, and the court adopted its
usual policy under such circumstances—let her be undisturbed. Few
of the men cared to risk the satirical answers that came readiest to her
lips when she was roused out of such a mood as this.</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet at last someone did venture to rouse her; and a smile, delicious
as a burst of sunshine, came swiftly and suddenly on her mouth.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was Hilary Estanol. Pale, worn, the mere ghost of himself, his
dark eyes looking strangely large in the white face they were set <a id='corr447.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in'>in.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_447.35'><ins class='correction' title='in'>in.</ins></a></span>
They were fixed on her as though there were nothing else in the world
to look at.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta held out her hand to him; his companion—a military officer who
had brought him under protest, and in some doubt, for Hilary had no
friends at Court—drew back in amazement. He understood now Hilary’s
importunity.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary bent over Fleta’s hand and held his lips near it for an instant,
but did not touch it. A sort of groan came to her ear from his lips.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have resigned me?” she asked in a low vibrating whisper.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You have cast me off,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Be it so,” she replied, “but you have lived through it, and you
now claim nothing. Is it not so? I read it in the dumb pain in your
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>“Yes,” said Hilary, straightening himself and standing upright close
beside her, and looking down upon her beautiful dark head. “It is so.
I will not cry for the moon, nor will I weary any woman with my regret
or entreaty, even you, Fleta, though it is no dishonour to humble oneself
at the feet of such as you. No; I will bear my pain like a man. I
came here to say good-bye. You are still something like the Fleta that
I loved. To-morrow you will not be.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How can you tell?” she said with her inscrutable smile. “Still, I
think you are right. And now that we are no longer lovers will you
enter with me another bond? Will you be my comrade in undertaking
the great task? I know you are fearless.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The great task?” said Hilary vaguely, and he put his hand to his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The one great task of this narrow life—To learn its lesson and go
beyond it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes, I will be your comrade,” said Hilary in an even voice and
without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Then meet me at two this very morning at the gate of the garden-house
where you used to enter.”</p>

<p class='c028'>It was now just midnight. Hilary noticed this as he turned away, for
a little clock stood on a bracket close by. He looked at it, and looked
back at Fleta. Could she mean what she said? But already the Fleta
he knew had vanished; a cold, haughty, impassive young queen was
accepting the uninteresting homage of a foreign minister. The guests
were beginning to take their departure. Fleta and Otto did not propose
to take any journey in honour of their wedding as is the custom in some
places; the king opened for their use the finest set of guests’ chambers
in the palace, and these they occupied, remaining among the visitors
until all had departed. On the next day Otto was to take his queen
home; but he had had to give way to the wishes of Fleta and her father
as to the postponing of the journey.</p>

<p class='c028'>From the great drawing-rooms Fleta went quietly away when the last
guest had departed; she moved like a swift shadow noiselessly along
the corridors. She entered her own room, and there began, without
summoning any attendant, to hastily take off her bridal robes. On
a couch was lying the white robe and cloak which she had worn when
she had endeavoured to enter the hall of the mystics. These she put
on, and wrapping the cloak round her turned to leave the room. As
she did so she came face to face with Otto, who had entered noiselessly,
and was standing in silence beside her. She seemed scarcely to notice
him, but changed her direction and proceeded towards another door.
Otto quickly placed himself again in her way.</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” he said; “you do not leave this room to-night.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“And why?” asked Fleta, looking gravely at his set face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Because you are now my wife. I forbid it. Stay here, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>me. Come, let me take off that cloak, without any trouble; the
white gown under it suits you even better than your wedding-dress.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He unfastened the clasps which held the cloak together. Fleta made
no opposition, but kept her eyes on his face; he would not meet
her gaze, though his face was white and rigid with the intensity of his
passion and purpose.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you remember,” said Fleta, “the last thing that you did when
you were with Father Ivan? Do you remember kneeling before him
and uttering these words—‘I swear to serve the master of truth and the
teacher of life——’”</p>

<p class='c028'>“That master—that teacher!” interrupted Otto hotly. “I reserved
my reason even in that incense-scented room. That master—that
teacher—is my own intelligence—so I phrased it in my own mind—I
recognise no other master.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Your own intelligence!” repeated Fleta. “You have not yet learned
to use it. You did not so phrase the vow then; you only rephrased it
so afterwards, when you were away, and alone, and began again to
struggle for your selfish freedom. No, Otto, you have not begun to use
your intelligence. You are still the slave of your desires, eaten up with
the longing for power and the lust of the tyrannical soul. You do not
love me—you only desire to possess me. You fancy your power is all
you wish it to be. Well, put it to the test. Take this cloak from my
shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Otto came close, and took the cloak in his hands; and then a sudden
passion filled him—he seized her in his arms and pressed his lips to
hers—yet he did not do so, either, for the attempt was instantaneously
surrendered. He staggered back, white and trembling.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta stood erect and proud before him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“That vow you took,” she said quietly, “you knew very well in the
inner recesses of your soul, in your true unblinded self, to make you a
slave of the Great Order. That vow may yet save you from yourself,
if you do not resent it too fiercely. But remember this; I am a
neophyte of that order, and you being its slave, are under my command.
I am your queen, Otto, but not your wife.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She passed him as she said this, and he made no effort to detain
her; indeed, the trembling had not yet left him, and his whole strength
was taken by the attempt to control it. As she reached the door he
succeeded in speaking:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Why did you marry me?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Did I not tell you?” she said, pausing a moment and turning to
look at him. “I think I did. Because I have to learn to live on the
plain as contentedly as on the mountain tops. There is but one way
for me to do this, and that is to devote my life as your queen to the
same great purpose it would serve were I the silver-robed initiate I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>desire to be. I go now to commence my work, with the aid of a lover
who has learned to surrender his <a id='corr450.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='love.'>love.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_450.2'><ins class='correction' title='love.'>love.”</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c028'>She moved magnificently from the room, looking much taller even
than her natural height. And Otto let her go without any word or
sign.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class='c035'>It was a fragrant night—a night rich with sweet flower-scents, not only
from the flower beds near, but coming from afar on the breeze. Hilary
stood at the gate, leaning on it and looking away at the sky, where a
faint streak of different light told of the sun’s coming. It was quite
clear, though there had been no moonlight; one of those warm, still
nights when it is easy to find one’s way, though hard to see into the face
of one near by, a night when one walks in a dream amid changing
shadows, and when the outer mysteriousness and the dimness of one’s
soul are as one. So with Hilary; so had he walked to the gate. He
waited for the woman he loved, the only woman any man could
ever love, having once known her. And yet no fever burned now in his
veins, no intoxication mounted from his heart to his brain. Standing
there, and regarding himself and his own feelings very quietly in the
stillness, it seemed to him as if he had died yesterday when that wild
cry had been unknowingly uttered; as if his soul or his heart, or,
indeed, his very self had gone forth in it.</p>

<p class='c028'>A light touch was laid on his shoulder, and then the gate was opened.
He passed through and walked by Fleta up the flower-bordered pathway.
She moved on without speaking, her white cloak hanging loose
from her neck, and her bare arms gleaming as it fell back from
them.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You who know so much tell me something,” said Hilary. “Why are
you so wise?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Because I burned my soul out centuries ago,” said Fleta. “When
you have burned out your heart you will be strong as I am.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Another question,” said Hilary. “Why did you fail in that
initiation?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta stopped suddenly, and fixed fierce questioning eyes upon him.
She was terrible in this quick rush of anger. But Hilary looked on her
unmoved. It seemed to him that nothing would ever be able to move
him again. Was he dead indeed that he could thus endure the scorching
light of those brilliant eyes?</p>

<p class='c028'>“What makes you ask me that?” cried Fleta in a voice of pain. “Do
you demand to know?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Yes; I do wish to know.”</p>

<p class='c028'>For a moment Fleta covered her face with her hands, and her whole
form shrank and quivered. But only for a moment; then she dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>her hands at each side and stood erect, her queenly head poised
royally.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is my punishment,” she said in a murmuring voice, “to discover
so soon how absolute are the bonds of the Great Order; how the pupil
can command the master as well as the master the pupil.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Then she turned abruptly upon Hilary, approaching him more nearly,
while she spoke in a quick, fierce voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Because, though I have burned out my soul, I have not burned out
my heart! Because, though I cannot love as men do, and have almost
forgotten what passion means, yet I can still worship a greater nature
than my own so deeply that it may be called love. I have not learned
to stand utterly alone and to know myself as great as any other with the
same possibilities, the same divinity in myself. I still lean on another,
look to another, hunger for the smile of another. O, folly, when I know
so well that I cannot find any rest while that is in me. O, Ivan, my
teacher, my friend, what torture it is to wrest the image of you from its
shrine within me. Powers and forces of indifferent Nature, I demand
your help!”</p>

<p class='c028'>She raised her arms as she uttered this invocation, and it struck
Hilary at the moment how little like a human being she looked. She
might have been the spirit of the dawn. Her voice had become unutterably
weird and mournful, like the deep cry of a broken soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>Without pausing for any answer she dropped her arms, drew her cloak
around her, and walked away over the dewy grass. Hilary, as silent, as
mournful, but seemingly without emotion, dropped his head and quietly
followed her track. Of old—only yesterday—what an age ago!—he
would have kept his eyes fixed on her shining dark hair or the movements
of her delicate figure. Suddenly Fleta stopped, turned and
confronted him. He raised his eyes in surprise and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are no longer devoured by jealousy,” she said. “You can hear
me speak as I did just now without its turning you into a savage. What
has happened?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Her eyes seemed to penetrate his impassive and languid expression,
looking for the soul beneath. She was longing that his answer should
be the one she needed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am hopeless,” answered Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Of what?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“Of your love. I understand at last that you have a great purpose
in your life, and that I am a mere straw on a stream. I thought I had
some claim on you; I see I cannot have. I surrender myself to your
will. That is all I have left to do.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta stood meditatively for a moment Then she looked up very
sadly in his face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“It is not enough,” she said. “Your gift must be a positive one.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Then she again turned and went on her way to the house. Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>everything was silent and even dark, for the shutters were all closed, and
evidently the place was deserted. Fleta opened a side door with a key
which was attached to her girdle; they entered and she locked it behind
them. She led the way through the quiet dim house to the door
of the laboratory; they entered the room in silence. It wore a quite new
aspect to Hilary’s eyes, and he looked round in wonder. All was pale;
there was no incense burning, no lamps were lit; the colour had gone from
the walls; a faint grey light through a skylight, which had always hitherto
been curtained, dimly broke on the darkness of the room which still
lurked deeply in the lower part. But Hilary found enough light to see
that the thing he so hated was not present; that lay figure which was to
him always such a horror was gone.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Where is it?” he said after a moment, wondering at the sense of
relief with which its absence filled him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What?—oh! the figure. Again you ask a question which I am
compelled to answer. Well, I cannot use that power at present; I have
again to win the right.”</p>

<p class='c028'>“How did you win the right before?” asked Hilary, fixing his eyes
on her; a fierce desire to know this possessed him.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta started, turned towards him, and for a moment the proud
imperiousness which ordinarily characterised her came over her form
and her features. But in another moment it was gone. She stood
before him, pale, gentle and sublime.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will tell you,” she said in a clear yet very low voice. “By taking
your life.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary looked at her in complete perplexity and bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do you not remember,” she said, “that forest, that new earth and sky,
all so sweet and strong, that wealth of apricot blossom that came
between us and the sky? Ah, Hilary, how fresh and vivid life was then,
while we lived and loved and understood not that we did either! Was
it not sweet? I loved you. Yes, I loved you—loved you.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Her voice broke and trembled. Hilary’s numbed heart suddenly
sprang again to life. Never had her voice contained such tones of
tenderness and passion before.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, my dear, my Fleta, you love me still—now!”</p>

<p class='c028'>He sprang towards her, but she seemed to sweep him aside with one
majestic action of her bare arm.</p>

<p class='c028'>“With that passion,” she said, with a pale solemnity, “I can never love
now. I have not forgotten entirely what such love is—no, Hilary, I
have not forgotten—else how should I have found you again among the
multitudes of the earth?” She held out her hand to him, and, as he
clasped it, he felt it was soft and tender, that the warm life
blood of a young creature responded to his touch. “I knew you by
your dear eyes which once were so full of pure love for me that they
were like stars in my life.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>“What came between us?” asked Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>She looked strangely at him, drew her hand away, folded her cloak
round her and then answered in one word:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Passion!”</p>

<p class='c028'>“I remember it now!” cried Hilary in sudden excitement “My
God! I see your beautiful wild face before me, I see your lips as lovely
as the soft blossom above us. Fleta, I loved you as men love—I
hungered for you—what harm lay in that?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“None,” she answered, standing now motionless and statue-like,
wrapped in her long, white cloak, seeming like a lovely ghost rather
then a living woman. “None—for men who care only to be men, to
reproduce men, to be and to do nothing more than that! But I had
another power within me, that seemed stronger than myself—a stirring
of the dumb soul within. When that moment came, Hilary, then came
the great decision, the fierce struggle between two souls hurled together
out of the dimness of life, and finding light in the fever of love—yes,
light!—the fire that is love makes it possible for men to live. It gives
them hope, it animates them, it makes them believe in a future, it
enables them to create men to fill that future.</p>

<p class='c028'>“In those old days beneath those apricot blossoms, you and I,
Hilary, were but children on this earth, new to its meaning, knowing
nothing of its purpose. How could we guide ourselves? We were
ignorant of the great power of sex, we were only at the beginning of its
lesson. So it must be with all. They must go through with the lesson,
they cannot guess it from the first! Nor could we. I did not know
what I did, Hilary, my lover, when I took your life. Had I known I
should only have been like a beast of prey. But I did not know. You
asserted your power—you claimed me. I asserted mine—I conquered.
I wanted power; and killing you as I did with that one emotion only
stirring within me, I got what I longed for. Not at once—not till I had
suffered patiently, not till I had struggled hard to understand myself
and the force that was at work within me. And this for life after life, incarnation
after incarnation. You not only loved me but you were mine—I
conquered you and used your life and love for my own ends—to add
to my power, to actually create the life and strength I needed. By your
life, by your strength, I became a magician, read by my insight the
mysteries of alchemy and the buried secrets of power. Yes, Hilary, it is
so. To you I owe myself. I have become free from the common
burdens of humanity, its passions, its personal desires, its weary
repetitions of experiences till their edge grows blunted by long usage.
I have seen the Egyptian and the Roman, men of the old superb
civilisations, trying to reproduce their past pleasures, their past magnificence
to-day, in this modern life. It is useless, life after life full of
selfishness and pleasure, ends in the weariness of living that kills men’s
souls and darkens their thought. But you and I, Hilary, have escaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>from this dismal fate. I would not be content to live again as I had lived
before, to use the life principle which lies in love, only for pleasure or the
bringing of eidolons on to the earth. I determined to rise, to raise myself,
to raise you, and out of our love perpetually to create something nobler
than we ourselves. I have succeeded, Hilary, I have succeeded. We
stand now before the gate of the first initiation. I tried to enter it and
failed for want of strength—for want of strength, Hilary! I could not
pluck my master’s image utterly out of my soul—I looked for him to
lean on—at least to find comfort in seeing that face I knew. Give me
strength, Hilary! Be my comrade! Help me to enter and your
strength shall come back to you a hundredfold. For your reward shall
be that you too shall enter with me.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She had changed from moment to moment as she spoke. She looked
like an inspired priestess—like a Divine being. Now she stood like a
flame with a strange appearance, as if her whole soul and self, spirit and
body, rose upwards in adoration. The dawn had come; the first rays
of the sun shot through the skylight and fell on her transfigured face
and gleaming hair.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary looked at her as a worshipper might look at his idol.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I am yours,” he said, “but I know not how to prove it.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She held out her hand to him, and lowered her eyes from the light to
which they had been raised until they met his.</p>

<p class='c028'>“We must discover the great secret together, Hilary. No longer may
you give yourself to me without knowledge. Hitherto our lives have
been but the lives of the blossom; now we must be wise and enter the
state when the fruit comes. We have to find out what that power is
which the sun represents to us; to discover the pure creative power.
But we have not strength yet, Hilary; alas! I dread and fear sometimes.
More strength means more sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She drew her cloak closer round her, the light faded from her eyes
and face, and turning away she went and sat down on a couch which
was back in the shadow. Hilary felt a profound sense of sadness, of
sympathy, of sorrow, sweep over his being. He followed her and sat
down beside her. One pale hand lay on the couch, outside her cloak.
He laid his upon it, and fell deep into thought. Thus they sat, silent,
breathing softly, for long hours, till the sun was high. But still, even
then, the room was very dim and cool, and full of shadows.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class='c035'>On the next day, the same day rather, for they sat together in the
laboratory till long after the sun was high, Hilary, to his own amazement,
found that he had an official post in the household of the young
Queen which would keep him continually about her. Indeed, he had to
pack up instantly on being informed of the fact, in order to follow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>Fleta to her own dominions. How this had been effected none could
tell—Hilary, least of all, for he saw immediately on presenting himself
in King Otto’s presence that he was regarded by him with dislike and
distrust. Before, Otto had scarcely noticed him. The present state of
things was decidedly a change for the worse. However, Hilary had
already perceived very clearly that to serve under Fleta was to serve
under a hard master. And he had no longer any kind of choice. Life
was inconceivable without her—without the pain caused by her difficult
service. He had rather suffer that than enjoy any other kind of
pleasure. And, indeed, pleasure, apart from Fleta, did not appear
to him to exist.</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet he was still capable of doubting her.</p>

<p class='c028'>Fleta had chosen a companion of royal birth to travel with her; a
young duchess who bore the same family name as Fleta herself. This girl
had been reared in a nunnery, and then taken to court, where she took part
in all the pageants and immediately found herself surrounded by suitors.
She was not very pretty, and certainly not at all clever. To go with
Fleta seemed to her delightful, as it would introduce her to a new court
and a fresh series of suitors. It struck Hilary as quite extraordinary
that Fleta should choose this child as her companion—not that the
Duchess was any younger than Fleta—indeed, they were almost of an
age; but Fleta appeared to carry within her beautiful head the wisdom
of centuries, while the Duchess was a mere school-girl trained in court
etiquette.</p>

<p class='c028'>These three were to travel together in Fleta’s own favourite travelling
carriage. She simply refused to travel with her husband. When he
addressed her on the subject, she merely replied:</p>

<p class='c028'>“You would weary me; and, moreover, I have work to do.”</p>

<p class='c028'>And so they started; and as Hilary took his place, he thought of
that strange drive when he and Fleta, and Father Amyot, had been the
three. Recollecting this made him wonder what had become of Father
Amyot; for the priest had not returned to his duties in the city. He
asked Fleta, while the thought was in his mind, why Amyot was not
with her now.</p>

<p class='c028'>“He is of no use to me,” she answered coldly.</p>

<p class='c028'>The journey was a very long and a very weary one to Hilary; for
the Duchess, finding no one else to flirt with, insisted upon flirting with
him; while Fleta lay back in her corner of the carriage hour after hour,
with her eyes closed. What was the work she had to do? Hilary, who
had overheard her answer to the King, wondered very much. And yet,
as he watched her intently he saw that her face changed. It grew darker,
more inscrutable, more set in purpose.</p>

<p class='c028'>Late one evening, and when they were indeed travelling later than
usual, hoping to reach their destination that same night, a curious thing
happened. All day long Fleta had been silent, seemingly buried in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>thought; but sometimes when Hilary was watching her he noticed her
lips move as if in speech. He sat opposite her whenever he could; this
was not always possible, as the young Duchess would talk to him, and
the carriage being very large and roomy, he had to change his position,
and go nearer to her in order to carry on a conversation with any
comfort. But as it grew dark the Duchess grew tired, and
leaned back half asleep, for indeed they had had a long day’s
journey.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary withdrew himself to the corner opposite Fleta. It grew so
dark he could no longer see her; they had a swinging-lamp in the roof
of the carriage, but he did not want to light it unless Fleta wished it so;
and, indeed, he longed for the quiet and the darkness very much. It
made him feel more alone with her, he could try to follow and <a id='corr456.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sieze'>seize</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_456.14'><ins class='correction' title='sieze'>seize</ins></a></span> her
thoughts then without the perpetual disturbance of the little Duchess’s
quick eyes on him and her light voice in his ears.</p>

<p class='c028'>He sat still and thought of Fleta—Fleta herself in her glorious
beauty—sitting there opposite him shrouded by the darkness. He could
endure it no longer—the man rose up in him and asserted itself—he
leaned forward and put his hand upon her. He had scarcely done so
when the Duchess uttered a shrill cry.</p>

<p class='c028'>“My God!” she exclaimed, in a voice of horror, “who is in the
carriage with us?”</p>

<p class='c028'>She flung herself across and knelt upon the floor between Hilary
and Fleta; her terror was so great she did not know what she was
doing.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary leaned across her and instantly discovered that she was
right—that there was another man in the carriage besides himself.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Oh, kill him! kill him!” cried the little Duchess, in an agony of
fear; “he is a thief, a murderer, a robber!”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary rose up and precipitated himself upon this person whom he
could not see. A sense of self-defence, of defence of the women with him,
seized him as we see it seize the animals. He discovered that this man
had risen also. Blindly and furiously he attacked him, and with extraordinary
strength. Hilary was young and full of vigour, but slight and
not built like an athlete. Now, however, he seemed to be one. He
found his adversary to be much larger and stronger than himself.</p>

<p class='c028'>A fearful struggle followed. The carriage drove on through unseen
scenery as fast as possible; Fleta could have stopped it had she thrown
the window down and cried out to the postilions. But Fleta remained
motionless—she might have fainted, she was so still. The little Duchess
simply cowered on the ground beside her, clinging to her motionless
figure. This terrified girl had not the presence of mind to think of
stopping the carriage, and so obtaining help. She was too horror-struck
to do anything. And, indeed, it was horrible, for the swaying struggling
forms sometimes were right upon the two women, sometimes at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>other side of the carriage; it was a deadly, horrible, ghastly struggle,
all the more horrid for the silence. There were no cries, no exclamations,
for indeed, so far as Hilary was concerned, he had no breath to
spare for them. There were only gasps, and heavy breathings, and the
terrible sound that comes from a man’s throat when he is fighting for
his life. How long this hideous battle lasted none could tell—Hilary
had no idea of the passage of time. The savage in him had now come
so entirely uppermost and drowned all other consciousness, that his one
thought was he must kill—kill—kill—and at last it was done. There
was a moment when his adversary was below him, when he could use
his whole force upon him—and then came a gasp and an unearthly cry—and
silence.</p>

<p class='c028'>Absolute silence for a little while. No one moved, no one stirred.
The Duchess was petrified with horror. Hilary had sunk exhausted on
the seat of the carriage—not only exhausted, but bewildered, for a host
of other emotions besides savage fury began to rise within him. What—who—-was
this being he had destroyed? At that moment they were
urged into a gallop, for they were entering the city gates. Hilary threw
down the window next him with a crash. “Lights, lights!” he cried out,
“bring lights.” The carriage stopped, and there was a crowd immediately
at the windows, and the glare of torches fell into the carriage,
making it bright as day. The little Duchess was crouched in the
corner on the ground in a dead faint. Fleta sat up, strangely white, but
calm. Nothing else was to be seen, alive or dead, save Hilary himself;
and so horror-struck was he at this discovery that he turned and buried
his face in the cushions of the carriage, and he never knew what
happened—whether he wept, or laughed, or cursed—but some strange
sound of his own voice he heard with his ears.</p>

<p class='c028'>There was a carriage full of servants behind Fleta’s carriage; when
hers stopped so suddenly they all got out and came quickly to the
doors.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The Duchess has fainted,” said Fleta, rising so as to hide Hilary;
“the journey has been too long. Is there a house near where she can
lie still a little while, and come on later to the palace?”</p>

<p class='c028'>Immediately offers of help were made, and the servants and those
who were glad to help them carried the poor little Duchess away.</p>

<p class='c028'>“On to the palace!” cried Fleta, and shut the door and drew down
the blinds. The postilion started the horses with all speed.</p>

<p class='c028'>Suddenly the blood in Hilary’s body began to surge and burn.
Was it Fleta’s arms that clung round him? Fleta’s lips that printed
warm, living kisses on his neck, his face, his hair? He turned and faced
her.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Tell me the truth,” he said. “Are you a devil?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“No,” she answered, “I am not. I want to find my way to the pure
good that governs life. But there are devils about me, and you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>killed one of them to-night. Hush, calm yourself; remember what
we are in the eyes of the world. For we are at the palace door, and
Otto is standing there to receive us.”</p>

<p class='c028'>She stepped out, the young queen.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary followed her, stumbling, broken. He said he was ill, to those
who spoke to him; and stood staring in wonder at the brilliant sight
before him.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class='c035'>The great hall of the palace was illuminated gloriously by huge dragons
made of gold, placed high up on the walls; within these strange creatures
were powerful lamps, which shed their light not only through the eyes
and opened mouths, but from the gleaming claws. The whole place was
filled with a blaze of light from them; and the dresses of the household
assembled below seemed to Hilary another blaze of light, so gay were
they. Yet this was only a domestic reception. It was late, and
Otto had refused to allow any more general demonstration to take
place that night. Yet Fleta, when she threw off her travelling cloak
and hood, might have been the centre of any pageant. She showed no
trace of the weariness of travel, or even of the strange excitement she
had passed through. She was pale, but her face was calm and wore its
most haughty and unapproachable expression. Her dress of black lace
hung about her slender form like clouds. Otto was filled with pride as
he noted her superb dignity and beauty; with hatred, as he observed
that her eyes never met his own, that she treated him with just the same
civility as the steward, or any servant of the establishment. No one
could notice this but himself and perhaps Hilary, supposing the latter
to be capable of regarding anyone but Fleta herself; for she was too
much a woman of the world, this mystic, this wild girl, to admit anyone
even to the most evident of the secrets of her life.</p>

<p class='c028'>After a few moments passed among the little crowd assembled in the
great hall, Fleta proposed to go to her own rooms for the night, and a
stately little procession formed itself at once to conduct her there. But
before going she beckoned to Hilary.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The Duchess must come to me to-night,” she said. “I wish her to
be in my own room. Send a carriage and servants to fetch her.”</p>

<p class='c028'>How her eyes glittered! Had he ever seen them shine so vividly
before?</p>

<p class='c028'>“Tell me one thing,” he said hoarsely. “I believe you have taken to
yourself that creature’s life and very body that I killed for you. Is it
not true?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“You are shrewd,” she said with a laugh. “Yes, it is true. My
whole being is stronger for his death; I absorbed his vital power the
instant you wrenched it from him.”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>“And he?” said Hilary, with wild eyes.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Was one of those half-human, half-animal creatures that haunt men
to their ill, and which fools call ghosts or demons. I have done him a
service in taking his life into my own.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary shuddered violently.</p>

<p class='c028'>“You doubt me,” said Fleta very quietly. “You still doubt if it is
not I who am the devil. Be it so. I am indifferent to your opinion of
me, Hilary; you cannot help loving and serving me. We were born
under the same star. Now go and give orders about the Duchess.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Under the same star! Those words had not come to his mind for a
long while; yet how horribly true they were. For he, Hilary, it was
who had actually done this dreadful deed and killed this unseen, unknown,
unimaginable creature. Horror made him clutch his hands
together as he thought that he had touched this thing, more, had killed
it hideously. Might it not have been some good thing striving to baffle
Fleta? Ah, yes! he still doubted her. And yet to doubt her so completely
made the very earth to sink away from under his feet. He
himself, his life, his all, were given to her, be she good or evil! Staggering
and overpowered by the terrible thoughts that crushed his wearied
brain, Hilary found his way to a supper-table; and too exhausted to
think of anything else but recruiting his strength, sat down to drink
wine—and to try to eat. This latter seemed impossible, but the wine
revived him; and presently he remembered that it was his business to
look after the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c028'>By-and-bye she was carried into the palace; she could not yet stand,
for she had only come out of one fainting fit to fall into another.</p>

<p class='c028'>And now came a strange and dreadful scene—one which only a few
witnessed, Hilary as it happened being among those few, for he saw the
Duchess taken to the suite of rooms Fleta occupied. In the corridor
Fleta came out to them; she was still in her travelling-dress, and looked
very quiet and even subdued. But at the sight of her the young
Duchess screamed as if she saw some awful thing; she would not let
Fleta touch her, she absolutely refused to enter her room.</p>

<p class='c028'>“But you must be with me,” said Fleta in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I will not,” answered the Duchess with a firm resolution which
amazed everyone who knew her. She rose up and walked unassisted
along the corridor and down the great staircase; she met the young
king coming up it; he had heard her shrill cries and came to see what
was happening.</p>

<p class='c028'>“What is the matter, little cousin?” seeing her tear-stained and
agitated face.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Fleta wants me to be in her room all night! I would not do it for
all the world! She is a devil—she would kill me or make her lover kill
me, and then no one would ever hear of me or even find my body. No!
No!”</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>And so she ran on, down the wide stairs, leaving Otto thunderstruck.
He noticed that a number of persons were gathering on the landing
and stairs, and so, with a stern and quiet face, he passed through the
little throng, making no observation. He went down the corridor and
straight into Fleta’s room. Here he found her standing silent, dark,
like a sombre statue. One other person was in the room—Hilary
Estanol. He was in the most extraordinary state of agitation, pouring
out words and accusations; some horror appeared to possess and blind
him, for he took no notice of the king’s entrance. Fleta did, however;
she looked up at him and smiled—such a strange, sweet, subtle smile.
Seldom, indeed, had Fleta given him a look like this. Otto’s heart
leaped within him, and he knew himself her slave. For he loved her
increasingly with every passing moment; and she had but to turn her
face on him softly to make the loving soul in him burn with ardour.
But that burning was fiery indeed. He turned upon Hilary and stayed
his words by a sudden sharp order:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Leave the room,” he said. “And you had better go and see Doctor
Brandener before you go to bed, for you are either in a fever or mad.
Go at once.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary was in a condition in which an order given in such a tone took
the place of the action of his own brain, and he mechanically obeyed it.
This was the best possible thing that could have happened to him; for
he was in fact in a high fever, and if he had not, without thinking about
it, done as he was told and gone to the resident doctor of the palace, he
would probably have wandered raving about all night. As it was he
was obliged to drink a strong sleeping draught, and was placed in his
bed, where he fell at once into a sleep so profound it seemed like
death.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hilary gone, Fleta closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Do not let there be any struggle of wills between us to-night,” said
Fleta very softly. “I warn you, I am much stronger than I was; I am
very much stronger than you are, now. And you found before that you
could not even come near enough to touch me. Let me rest, and that
quietly; I wish to retain my beauty, both for your sake and my
own.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Otto paused a few moments before he made any answer to this
extraordinary speech. Then he spoke with difficulty; and as he did so
raised his hand to brush away some great drops of sweat which had
gathered on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I know I am powerless against you to-night, Fleta,” he said. “I
cannot even move nearer to you. But be warned; I intend to probe the
mystery of your being. I intend to conquer you at last. I will do it if
I have to visit hell itself for the magic which shall be stronger than
yours.”</p>

    <div>EDITORS’ NOTE.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>This second part of the three which form the bulk of the poem called “Twilight
Visions” by their author—from a purely Kabalistic standpoint of universal symbolical
Esotericism, is most suggestive. Its literary value is apparent. But literary form in
occultism counts for nothing in such mystic writing if its spirit is sectarian—if the
symbolism fails in universal application or lacks correctness. In this, Part II., however
(of the third to come we can yet say nothing), the Christian-Judæan names may
be altered and replaced by their Sanskrit or Egyptian equivalents, and the ideas will
remain the same. It seems written in the universal “mystery-language,” and may be
readily understood by an occultist, of whatever school or nationality. Nor will any true
mystic, versed in that international tongue, whose origin is lost in the dark night of
pre-historic ages, fail to recognise a true Brother, who has adopted the phraseology of
the Initiates of the ancient Judæan Tanaim—Daniel and St. John of the Apocalypse—and
partially that of the Christian Gnostics, only to be the more readily understood
by the profane of Christian lands. Yet the author means precisely the same thing
that would be in the mind of any Brahminical or Buddhist Initiate, who, while
deploring the present degenerated state of things, would place all his hope in the
transient character of even the <em>Kali Yuga</em>, and trust in the speedy coming of the
Kalki Avatar. We say again, the divine Science and Wisdom—<cite>Theosophia</cite>—is universal
and common property, and the same under every sky. It is the physical type
and the outward appearance in the dress, that make of one individual a Chinaman
and of another a European, and of a third a red-skinned American. The inner man is
one, and all are “Sons of God” by birth-right.</p>

<p class='c028'>The editors regret that, by an over-sight, the sub-title, “The Cross,” that headed
Part I. of “Twilight Visions,” published in our January number, should have been
omitted.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c034'>
    <div>By the Author of “A Professor of Alchemy.”</div>
    <div class='c000'>(<i>Continued.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>“Margaret had been in grief so sad and potent since her
brother’s death, that it at last brought her into a fever, from
which, with difficulty, she recovered, and which kept her long
to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c028'>“During this time the monk roamed like a restless spirit, seeming to
seek her, and despairing because he found her not. Giles Hughson even
went so far as to suspect he was no true priest at all, until he had seen
his tonsure. Even then he was drawn into most sacrilegious surmises
by what he beheld some few nights after.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Having some work to do in Castle Troyes garden, he noted the White
Monk, his lodger, glide noiselessly through the grounds, hidden behind
the thick black walls of yew, and pause under the casement of Mistress
Margaret and stand there listening intently for a certain space. At last,
with a gesture of despair, he slung himself with infinite agile stillness up
some feet of the ivy that covered the wall, from which insecure footing he
did long and earnestly search if he might see her shadow cross the room.
Giles, the gardener, swore afterwards that the sight of that priest, with
his cowl fallen back from his dark face, and that look of straining,
terrified attention had in it something so partaking of the unearthly, that
for the life of him he dared not accost the daring intruder. ‘Time
enough if there were need,’ he excused himself afterwards, ‘but Castle
Troyes is ever well enow defended, and at that time there must have
been enough of inmates watching over Margaret, the beautiful, to win
her back to life.’</p>

<p class='c028'>“The horrible recklessness of an act such as this, with the carbines of
a round thirty men within a few yards of him, made the monk seem to
Giles a creature of charmed life, who may not be addressed as
ordinary mortals.</p>

<p class='c028'>“But the White Monk saw his discoverer when he descended and
glided away again, scared by some noise made by Margaret’s attendants.
And thus there occurred a tragedy, which you shall learn as far as it was
ever known.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Now Giles Hughson had a young son afflicted with total dumbness,
but whom Mistress Margaret de Troyes had taught to write; and it is
through this scholarship of his that we come to know as much as we do
of what really happened. The White Monk appeared fond of this boy,
possibly because he had seen Margaret kiss him. Thus the lad had
greater access to the monk’s small attic than any other; and this is the
tale he tells of the night after Giles had espied his lodger clinging to the
wall of Castle Troyes.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>“The boy had noiselessly, so as not to disturb the often musings of
the solitary one, stepped up the attic stairs to fetch some trifle he wanted
of the monk. Pausing timidly at the door, he beheld the familiar white-clad
figure, with an air of terrible malignity, mixing some powder of a
greenish colour, which, at the sight of the intruder, he hastily laid aside,
thinking it had not been seen.</p>

<p class='c028'>“But the lad was unnerved by the expression he had caught on the
monk’s face, and he forgot not so lightly.</p>

<p class='c028'>“At the frugal supper, that very night, he observed the monk ate even
less than was his wont, and of one dish only, the which he also pressed
upon the young lad by his side, seeming to wish to keep the others from
him. The others of the family, Giles Hughson and his dame, did eat as
usual, and were both found dead on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The monk strove to comfort the poor boy by every means in his
power, but it was all of no avail. The lad seized a moment, fled into
the wood, and there wrote down all that he had seen and suspected, with
which account he presently did seek the justices. These caused proper
inquiry into the manner of the deaths of the workman and his wife to be
made, and, finding they had died of potent poison, instituted careful
search for the person of the White Monk, who had vanished from the
cottage.</p>

<p class='c028'>“At length they found him, in a strange state for one of his way of
living. Into the wood had he gone, but not so far as that he could hide
him. He had stopped beside a little brook, where he had sat when first
he saw fair Margaret, the sister of his victims. There, even there, was
he found, in so deep contemplation that he never heard his pursuers’
footsteps. He had made a cross of two elder branches (folk about us
say that the elder-wood formed the Cross whereon Christ died), and
having set it on the summit of a bank, was deep in prayer, as it seemed,
before it.</p>

<p class='c028'>“One of his Italian repentances, I doubt not.</p>

<p class='c028'>“He seemed in sore distress of mind, and lost to all thought of his
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c028'>“So they took him; the foreign wild beast, tracked at last. But not
without trouble for he fought like the panther he was. Escaping
lissomely from their hands at the moment when they would have bound
him, the ex-bravo snatched a genuine stiletto from the folds of his
monastic frock and stabbed one man to death, laughing coarsely at the
stupid astonishment of the harquebusiers to see this weapon in so
unseemly a hand.</p>

<p class='c028'>“He had no chance, being taken thus unawares, and exhaustion came
upon him; so, with tremours, the officers of justice held him fast.
Before the first cord was fastened round his struggling wrists, he fell back,
rigid, in their arms; sighed once or twice, smiled bitterly to himself at
their consternation, and flung his head back, dead.</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>“A small quantity of a green powder was found on him (a large dose,
I ween, had killed so hardy a villain!), and by comparing the signs of
death with those of Giles Hughson and his wife, they saw he had
poisoned himself some time within the last five hours. Whether he had
seen Margaret again, and by seeing her upon the earth, had come to
know himself too bad for it; or whether the weariness attendant upon
sins so heavy had worn him out at last, remains a mystery. The leeches
said a man so wasted and wan as this could scarce, in the way of Nature,
have lived many years longer; but I question this, and so did the men
who had so great trouble to hold him!</p>

<p class='c028'>“News travelled slowly in those days from Italy to England, and it
was not until very shortly after the White Monk’s death that our town
learnt it had harboured Pietro Rinucci, the slayer of the two good
brothers, Ambrose and Gilbert de Troyes. No one ever told Mistress
Margaret that she had spoken with such a man. And now the beautiful
maiden rose from her bed, and asked for her mostly costly gowns, of
amber, blue and rosy colours; and went amongst her friends brightly,
wreathed with pearls and radiant in smiles. She was thought to have
recovered, though she looked ethereal as a daisy or white cloud; but
she said and averred that she was dying, and that her brother Ambrose
had appeared to her in a vision, bidding her make all speed to do what
remained to her upon the earth and be soon ready, when he should come
behind the angels to fetch her hence. Her kinsfolk thought she
wandered in her mind. She asked for the man who had wooed her,
and held long speech with him, very merrily, and yet with tears;
beseeching him to pause e’er he rashly threw away his life on this earth,
since we know not in the beginning, whither our pleasant sins may carry
us, and when we have no enjoyment of them, save by memory, what
are they to us? The instruments of our present ruin.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘All this,’ said the lovely Margaret with a smile, ‘hath right off, my
Lord, been heard, by you and others; but from a lady’s lips (and that
lady who is even now bent to consider the past failings of her own life,
soon to be taken from her) it hath been made evident to me, these poor
oft-repeated words shall have some power. God bless you, my Lord—farewell.’</p>

<p class='c028'>“The gentleman came out from her boudoir exceeding sobered, and
essaying as he might to conceal his tears.</p>

<p class='c028'>“The words of this dying angel—for so indeed she seemed—he vowed
should be as a challenge to him from God to purify his ways. And
indeed from that day the gentleman made such progress in godliness as
can be made by one of his complexion.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And now a strange and terrible portent was observed.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Those who watched by the Lady Margaret, began to see a vision,
and of that most dreaded being, the White Monk!</p>

<p class='c028'>“Night or day, it mattered not; with a chill like to that of Death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>itself, the horrified watchers knew the presence of the phantom.
In the dark corners of the room would shape themselves dimly the
features of the murderer, Rinucci, and his monastic gown, so glaring
white in its dimness through the dark that the eye could not search it,
and gone, ever gone, if some bold spirit neared the spot where he had
thought he saw it.</p>

<p class='c028'><a id='corr469.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='No'>“No</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_469.7'><ins class='correction' title='No'>“No</ins></a></span> one said aught of this to the Lady Margaret, in fear to fright
her; and she alone, of all who watched, did never see nor feel the
constant presence. It seemed sometimes as though the phantom
yearned to make itself visible to her kind, half-divine eyes, but her
thoughts were too high-set for it to be given her to see a sight so
horrible.</p>

<p class='c028'>“She was much upheld by visions then—her contemplative soul
shaped to itself many fair sights and sounds that others knew not.
Sitting by the open casement in her sun-coloured gown, with white
arms, pearl encircled, leaning out, and her smile ever brighter as she
murmured to herself, she would stretch far over the lattice and grasp
at rosy clouds, which she said floated past her in the peopled air. She
would reply, still leaning out and smiling, to what she vowed was said
to her by wandering happy spirits. And all this while, behind her,
there would stand the White Mystery, with slight hand lifting
the cowl from a face whose eyes were as deep as death and more
despairing.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Small marvel that the murderer’s ghost should cling to our saint
while she yet lived on earth! He may have known that, once dead,
restored to Heaven, she would thenceforth move in worlds where such
as he should never have the force to breathe.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And in her due hour she died; and after that for a space no one saw
aught of the dread ghost. His spirit, drawn by some power to enter
our house, wherein was held all he knew of goodness, had now no
further business there, for a while. His loathed name, fraught with
horror to your ancestors’ home, was now never spoken. It was thought,
doubtless, that since Margaret de Troyes—the innocent avenger—had
unwittingly caused the murderer’s death, the house he had so deeply
injured was for ever free from his godless presence. And, indeed, for
a while, the chronicles are silent respecting him. The next two generations
were happy, and no great misfortune blasted the house. But in
the third generation there were harsh feuds in the city, and much
bloodshed, and several of your name came to violent and sometimes
mysterious ends. Then it was that there arose a searching into past
traditions to discover the secret of a certain white spectre said to appear
about the castle previous to each calamity. Not all saw it; but still it
grew known, and it bore a marked resemblance to an ancient portrait—hung
up for curiosity’s sake—of Pietro Rinucci.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Well, young master, I myself served your grandfather, and I myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>can bear witness to the presence of the White Monk’s ghost on one of
the shrewd moments of the family destinies. Wilt hear it? So your
father was then a stalwart young man, away at the wars in Spain.
Your uncles, two blithe young gallants, were at home at the time I
speak of, and there was some merry-making toward in the castle.
Myself was seeing to the torches in the garden, when I chanced to see
your uncle, Geoffrey de Troyes, come hastily into the yew-walk with his
rapier drawn, followed by another youth whom I knew well, his rival,
and in some sort, his enemy.</p>

<p class='c028'>“As the guests danced within, these nobles fought without. A man
dared not have interposed; it was matter of life and death to them, and
they were there to prove it.</p>

<p class='c028'>“I was glad, as I stood on the further side the hedge, to mark the
vigour and the skill of our Geoffrey. Methought the vantage was with
him, and with my whole heart I hated his opponent, the cold, selfish
Ernle Deane, and wished him to succumb.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And so, by mine honour, he should have done, for my boy was the
pride of us all for swordsmanship; but it was not to be.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Geoffrey de Troyes never suffered more from his mortal wound than
I did in my heart and my pride, as I led him, bleeding piteously
to this very stable-room, where he sank on the hay and said he must
die.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘Look to it,’ groaned the poor young noble, as he lay dying, ‘that
Mistress Beatrice Savile has this token from me—my gold chain—warn
her from me when I am dead, that she wed not Ernle Deane—he
is bad to the core, and she is too good to mend him. Oh! but for that
hateful vision!’</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘What vision, a God’s name?’ I cried.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And he told me trembling—he who had never trembled of his whole
life!—that even at the moment when he had thought to subdue his
enemy—even as he raised his sword to strike home to a worthless heart—even
then had his arm fallen paralysed and a frightful shiver quite
unmanned him at the sight of a poor monk in white, who stood some
yards away, and raised his cowl with a thin white hand, and fixed
unearthly eyes upon him with a steadfast look that drew the soul away
from the deadliest earthly peril.</p>

<p class='c028'>“‘And so I fell!’ cried the shamed noble, crimsoning though the pallor
of exhaustion. ‘<em>I</em>—a practised hand, a not unworthy courage—a De
Troyes! I fell—for this!—and so would any man have fallen,’ he
defiantly ended, ‘for ’twas a devil—’twas Pietro Rinucci himself, who
came from hell to lure me from my hopes of earthly happiness. O, life!
O, Beatrice!’</p>

<p class='c028'>“And I nursed him and wept over him like any woman, whilst one
young, bright life more departed,</p>

<p class='c028'>“In truth, young master,” ended honest Ralph, “the noble Geoffrey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>may have been deceived, and fancied this; but, you shall pardon me, I
would rather think that armies of devils nightly march these grounds
than that one De Troyes was ever seen to quail, save under magic!
Thus it is that I, and that many of us yet believe in the spectre of Pietro
Rinucci, ‘the White Monk.’”</p>

<p class='c028'>Oh these faithful servitors, they would die for us children of the
house, I believe, and yet they have ever this curious bent to terrify
the childish minds. I know not when it was precisely that I thus first
heard the White Monk’s story, but this I know, I was young enough to
sit with my clenched fistlets supporting my chin, and my eyes and
mouth very wide open.</p>

<p class='c028'>“And was he always in <em>white</em>, that fearful man?” I asked, somewhere
toward the middle of the story. “<em>Always in white?</em>” I know
not why, but this detail struck my child’s phantasy more powerfully
than all the rest; <em>this</em> was awful, this was the pith of the whole matter,
and from that moment I sat trembling, and drinking in the history
with reluctant suspense, until it became the bane of my life for a term
of years.</p>

<p class='c028'>For hours I lay shuddering ofttimes in my bed, dreading with my
body and my soul lest the Monk should appear to me! And never had
I courage to speak of this to anyone of the many loving house mates who
would so promptly have put an end to my fears by leaving me no more
alone at night. There is a keen, hard honour for children to maintain,
and to them the confession of nocturnal terror is as flight to the soldier.
So, as the banquet sped its course below, I shuddered lonely in my bed
in the oaken room, often weeping angrily amidst my fears because I
alone, the only son of the house, was the only soul in it left
desolate.</p>

<p class='c028'>A little later I was comforted in some sort by my baby sister
Margaret, who was put to sleep in an adjacent cot, and being too tiny
for Fear to reach, would sleep secure, all gold and white in the
dusky gleam of our rushlight—the one oasis of hope throughout the
terrible oaken room. Yet she in her turn, became a source of fear to
me. Should the Monk appear, and should the dire extremity cause me
to shriek, what would become of Marguerite? She would die of sudden
terror. Worse—if he should stand by her bedside, raising his cowl off
the awful face, and her blue eyes should open at that instant? How
should I protect her?</p>

<p class='c028'>But before I wander further, I must begin straight and tell how we
lived, and where, and to what end.</p>

<div class='c037'>—<span class='sc'>Katha Upanishad.</span></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c045'>I (Âtman) have crossed the sea—I have reached the other shore—I
have triumphed over gravitation, my soul is in the sun-currents,
moving sunwards with the sun.</p>

<p class='c028'>Where the currents are bearing me to I scarcely know, but yet something
has been revealed.</p>

<p class='c028'>I died the mystical death, I was received by the Dawn-Maidens—the
bright ones of the eternal twilights, the two bright Ushas, Ahana and
Antigone, Isis, and Nephtys of Aanru.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c013'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>The Ahana-Aurora of Eternity laid me asleep on her bosom, giving
me <em>amrita</em><a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c013'><sup>[163]</sup></a> to drink, as Hebe gave to Herakles, and then I at once knew
that I (<em>Atman</em>) was immortal; the Mask of Personality had fallen to
earth, the Âtma was revealed—my true <span class='sc'>Self</span>—I knew my name,
and found myself soaring sunwards. Then the Voice of that <span class='sc'>Dawn</span>
said, “I give you the ‘Amrita’ of the cessation of deaths,” and her lips
burning with sun-ardours, kissed my forehead, and said, “I bring you to
the sun; when blind—on earth, that Sanskara of sorrow—you fancied
your sun was nothing but a great centre of physical force—light
and heat, and their equivalents; but it was Maya, the Earth-Queen of
illusions, who thus deceived your earth eyes. Look now, and you can
see nothing but a vast group of mighty spirit-wills clustered round a
yet mightier Spirit centre, drawing from thence inspiration, and ever-radiating
sun effluxes, for the good and advancement of those unhappy
lower wills yet sunk in the earth. What you called light was intelligence,
and heat was—love. Did not Koré suggest this to you, O my weak child,
for she, too, was one of the Ushas, a Maiden of the Dawn, kindling your
soul to love?”</p>

<p class='c028'>I was silent to this question, for a dread sorrow clung to me.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Though” (began again the Voice) “the sun-souls attract the earth-souls,
the lost ones, for a while, to bring them up to themselves by the
path that leads to Nirvana<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c013'><sup>[164]</sup></a> ‘where there is no sorrow’; yet the sun-groups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>of Spirits are themselves attracted by a grander centre of force,
and the Sun, with his planet-children, are speeding in a mighty orbit
round a far mightier Soul-centre—the lost Pleiad—lost on earth to be
found in Heaven. Dost thou not hear the solemn music of that tempest
flight?” And then she touched my ears, and I heard the myriad voiced
song of the blessed ones as they passed on rejoicing, and the
Voice continued: “That lost Pleiad, the dove-woman, the ‘Woman
Clothed with the Sun,’ who, as Jeremiah prophesied, should ‘compass
man,’ is that eternal womanhood which attracts all men.” And the
chorus of the psalm I heard them sing, as they passed on Pleiad-ward,
was “Freedom and Love—Love in Bi-unity. The Two in One foretold
has come even to earth.” And the souls in that Pleiad-world are
infinite in number as the sands of the seas of countless worlds, elective
affinities attract like to like, forming celestial choirs, each member of
which breathes the akasian air synchronously with the other, and what you
call in your earth-symbol-language their “hearts,” beat and throb in
unison together as one heart, and thus become coalesced in, and by,
love.</p>

<p class='c028'>“Listen, O my child, to the music of their breathing,” and I said, “Is
Koré there?” Then I heard voices in Heaven, and I began to breathe
the interior akasa breath synchronously with her—our breaths became
one, I was mingled with, and melted in her; and lo! a great mystery!
that Dawn-maiden changed to Koré, and Koré  gave me the amrita of
the Pleiad, and I knew that our biune love was immortal.</p>

<p class='c028'>I have passed over the deep waters, I am free, I have infinite peace
and infinite joy, at rest for ever.</p>

<p class='c028'>Have I not, like Herakles, slept on the bosom of Athéné, breathing
the wisdom of her breaths? I, too, breathe internally akasian love-breaths,
I live in the love-choirs of the Pleiad Sun, I am in the true
Nirvana, where there is no sorrow and no desire, for desire is lost in an
ever-abiding and eternal fruition. The Lotus has bloomed in the
Sun-fire,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c013'><sup>[165]</sup></a> and my soul is newborn in the pure white calyx, and floats
down the golden waters that wash the eternal shores. I have found the
“Path,” “suffering, and the cause of suffering” (separation from the
loved one) have been seen, and have passed away, whilst we ever rise
and pass onwards by the star-paths. I am no more blind, but, like
Orion of old, gazing eastwards on that rising sun, the red flush of whose
dawn is ever blushing in our central souls. I have received my sight.—<span class='sc'>Om</span>....</p>

<p class='c028'>Since writing the foregoing, A. J. C. has met with the following note
contained in Mr. Edwin Arnold’s interesting essay, “Death and Afterwards,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>which throws light on the views in said Rhapsody: “That which
safely bears our ‘solid world’ in the gulfs of space is no base or
basis, no moveless central rock, but <em>throbbing energies</em> in complex and
manifold action, <em>in swing and wave and thrill</em>; whirling us onward in
mighty sweeps of three-fold <a id='corr474.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='rhythm'>rythm</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_474.5'><ins class='correction' title='rhythm'>rythm</ins></a></span> <em>to which our hearts are set</em>. So
therefore not solidity of base in fixity of status is our supreme and vital
need, but moving <em>power beyond our ken or senses</em>; known to us in
<em>energising action</em>, and working through blue ‘void’; impelling us in rings
of spiral orbit round a moving sun in which we are dependent.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The same book contains Walt Whitman’s beautiful and striking
poem on Death, in which the poet says:</p>

<p class='c035'>Yes, one other, the writer of the foregoing Rhapsody, has attempted a

stated in beautiful verse years ago that the world had two good things
in it—Love and Death.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>OUR OTHER HALF.</h4>

<p class='c035'>When our ancient brethren, the Kabalists, Jewish as well as Oriental,
taught that the divine monad, starting on its long journey from the bosom
of the Infinite One was divided into halves, they had a double meaning,
one exoteric, the other esoteric. The exoteric one, being that the two
halves, swept through cycles upon cycles of time, in search of each
other; and, that, when they finally met, in a perfect union, or marriage,
the two halves became one on earth, and after death, united again.
The true explanation, however, the esoteric one, is, that each and every
one of us, contains within himself, both the halves: the feminine
predominating through some incarnations, the masculine through others.
It adds that, when we evolute into the perfect being, the Adept, the
Mahatma, both principles are in perfect harmony. Or, as the Kabalists
have recorded it, harmony is in equilibrium, and equilibrium exists by the
analogy of contraries. How often we discern in the most masculine of
men, distinct feminine traits of character, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>, in the gentlest
of the fair sex, discover masculine traits.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Jewish Kabbalists represented these two principles in the letters
forming their Ineffable Name. Its first three characters mean Eve, or
Eva, or Hâyah היה or woman, or by another reading it means mother,
and is, in fact, the proper name as given in Genesis for Eve, “the mother
of all living.” Adding the character י Yodh or Yah, the male, the
number one, the masculine, we have Jehovah, or Jah-eve, or being as
male-female, the perfect number—10, symbolised by the Sephirothal
Adam Kadmon.</p>

<p class='c028'>A few evenings ago, while pondering on this subject, in a room devoted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>to occult research, where an Eastern incense burning with a ruddy glow
on the triangular-shaped altar, sent its refreshing fragrance through the
apartment, my outer senses were lulled, and the inner ones came into
play, and I became conscious of my other “half.” I saw standing before
me, a being, whom I had hitherto considered as my guardian angel
stretching out her hands to me, and saying—“my beloved one, know thy-<em>self</em>.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The fire on the altar burnt low. The north-east wind, which had been
blowing in furious gusts outside, lashing the bosom of the lake into
white foam, died away, sounding like some far distant choral chant. An
unearthly silence ensued, and seemed to pervade the infinitudes of space.
A thousand voices spoke to me, saying, “Man, know thyself.” Shadowy,
ghostly forms filled the apartment. One, more distinct than the rest,
tall in form, clad in a long flowing garment of pure white, the long black
hair falling in curly locks over his shoulders, the silky beard reaching to
his waist, the light of centuries of centuries gleaming forth from his dark
eyes—extended his right hand toward me. A thrill of unutterable
delight passed through my being. Slowly I emerged from my earthly
casket, looked for an instant at its sleeping form, then felt irresistibly
drawn to the fair being, who still stood with outstretched hands, and
seemed to lose myself in her. The twain had become one. The mystic
union had taken place. For a few brief moments I realized the possibilities
of <em>jnânayoga</em>, the wisdom-power of the adepts. Space was
annihilated. I could see systems upon systems of worlds, galaxies of
stars, suns and systems of suns, whirling through space. I thought of
some distant place, and I was there. Complex problems solved
themselves quite naturally: I had become all <span class='fss'>THOUGHT</span>....</p>

<p class='c028'>The extended hand of the tall form flashed before my eyes, and I
became unconscious. When I awoke, I found lying on the altar a full-blown
white rose. The north-east wind was again roaring in fierce
gusts, the fire on the altar had died out. The mirrors had draped
themselves with their curtains of black. The two interlaced triangles
had merged into a circle, of pure gold in colour. Once more I took
upon myself my objective life. But I had solved the problem which
has taken me seven years to solve. I was content....</p>

  <h4 class='c023'>THE THREE DESIRES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c027'>The first three of the numbered rules of “Light on the Path” must
appear somewhat of an unequal character to bracket together.
The sense in which they follow each other is purely spiritual.
Ambition is the highest point of personal activity reached by the mind,
and there is something noble in it, even to an Occultist. Having conquered
the desire to stand above his fellows, the restless aspirant, in
seeking what his personal desires are, finds the thirst for life stand next
in his way. For all that are ordinarily classed as desires have long since
been subjugated, passed by, or forgotten, before this pitched battle of the
soul is begun. The desire for life is entirely a desire of the spirit, not
mental at all; and in facing it a man begins to face his own soul. But
very few have even attempted to face it; still fewer can guess at all at
its meaning.</p>

<p class='c028'>The connection between ambition and the desire of life is of this
kind. Men are seldom really ambitious in whom the animal passions
are strong. What is taken for ambition in men of powerful physique is
more often merely the exercise of great energy in order to obtain full
gratification of all physical desires. Ambition pure and simple is the
struggle of the mind upwards, the exercise of a native intellectual force
which lifts a man altogether above his peers. To rise—to be preeminent
in some special manner, in some department of art, science, or
thought, is the keenest longing of delicate and highly-tuned minds. It
is quite a different thing from the thirst for knowledge which makes of
a man a student always—a learner to the end, however great he may
become. Ambition is born of no love for anything for its own sake, but
purely for the sake of oneself. “It is I that will know, I that will rise,
and by my own power.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition;</div>
      <div class='line'>By that sin fell the angels.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>The place-seeking for which the word was originally used, differs in
degree, not in kind, from that more abstract meaning now generally
attached to it. A poet is considered ambitious when he writes for fame.
It is true; so he is. He may not be seeking a place at court, but he is
certainly seeking the highest place he knows of. Is it conceivable that
any great author could really be anonymous, and remain so? The
human mind revolts against the theory of the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare’s works, not only because it deprives the world of a splendid
figure, but also because it makes of Bacon a monster, unlike all other
human beings. To the ordinary intelligence it is inconceivable that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>man should hide his light in this purposeless manner. Yet it is conceivable
to an occultist that a great poet might be inspired by one greater
than himself, who would stand back entirely from the world and all
contact with it. This inspirer would not only have conquered ambition
but also the abstract desire for life, before he could work vicariously to
so great an extent. For he would part with his work for ever when
once it had gone to the world; it would never <a id='corr477.7'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='he'>be</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_477.7'><ins class='correction' title='he'>be</ins></a></span> his. A person who
can imagine making no claim on the world, neither desiring to take
pleasure from it nor to give pleasure to it, can dimly apprehend the
condition which the occultist has reached when he no longer desires
to live. Do not suppose this to mean that he neither takes nor
gives pleasure; he does both, as also he lives. A great man, full of
work and thought, eats his food with pleasure; he does not dwell on
the prospect of it, and linger over the memory, like the gluttonous
child, or the gourmand pure and simple. This is a very material image,
yet sometimes these simple illustrations serve to help the mind more
than any others. It is easy to see, from this analogy, that an advanced
occultist who has work in the world may be perfectly free from the
desires which would make him a part of it, and yet may take its
pleasures and give them back with interest. He is enabled to give more
pleasure than he takes, because he is incapable of fear or disappointment.
He has no dread of death, nor of that which is called annihilation.
He rests on the waters of life, submerged and sleeping, or above
them and conscious, indifferently. He cannot feel disappointment,
because although pleasure is to him intensely vivid and keen, it is the
same to him whether he enjoys it himself or whether another enjoys it. It
is pleasure, pure and simple, untarnished by personal craving or <a id='corr477.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='desire'>desire.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_477.27'><ins class='correction' title='desire'>desire.</ins></a></span>
So with regard to what occultists call “progress”—the advance from
stage to stage of knowledge. In a school of any sort in the external
world emulation is the great spur to progress. The occultist, on the contrary,
is incapable of taking a single step until he has acquired the faculty
of realizing progress as an abstract fact. Someone must draw nearer to
the Divine in every moment of life; there must always be progress.
But the disciple who desires that he shall be the one to advance in the
next moment, may lay aside all hope of it. Neither should he be
conscious of preferring progress for another or of any kind of vicarious
sacrifice. Such ideas are in a certain sense unselfish, but they are
essentially characteristic of the world in which separateness exists,
and form is regarded as having a value of its own. The shape of
a man is as much an <em>eidolon</em> as though no spark of divinity inhabited
it; at any moment that spark may desert the particular shape, and
we are left with a substantial shadow of the man we knew. It is in
vain, after the first step in occultism has been taken, that the mind
clings to the old beliefs and certainties. Time and space are known
to be non-existent, and are only regarded as existing in practical life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>for the sake of convenience. So with the separation of the divine-human
spirit into the multitudes of men on the earth. Roses have their
own colours, and lilies theirs; none can tell why this is when the same
sun, the same light, gives the colour to each. Nature is indivisible. She
clothes the earth, and when that clothing is torn away, she bides her
time and re-clothes it again when there is no more interference with her.
Encircling the earth like an atmosphere, she keeps it always glowing
and green, moistened and sun-lit. The spirit of man encompasses the
earth like a fiery spirit, living on Nature, devouring her, sometimes
being devoured by her, but always in the mass remaining more ethereal
and sublime than she is. In the individual, man is conscious of the vast
superiority of Nature; but when once he becomes conscious that he is
part of an indivisible and indestructible whole, he knows also that the
whole of which he is part stands above nature. The starry sky is a
terrible sight to a man who is just self-less enough to be aware of his
own littleness and unimportance as an individual; it almost crushes him.
But let him once touch on the power which comes from knowing himself
as part of the human spirit, and nothing can crush him by its greatness.
For if the wheels of the chariot of the enemy pass over his body,
he forgets that it is his body, and rises again to fight among the crowd
of his own army. But this state can never be reached, nor even approached,
until the last of the three desires is conquered, as well as the
first. They must be apprehended and encountered together.</p>

<p class='c028'>Comfort, in the language used by occultists, is a very comprehensive
word. It is perfectly useless for a neophyte to practise discomfort or
asceticism as do religious fanatics. He may come to prefer deprivation
in the end, and then it has become his comfort. Homelessness is
a condition to which the religious Brahmin pledges himself; and in the
external religion he is considered to fulfil this pledge if he leaves wife
and child, and becomes a begging wanderer, with no shelter of his own
to return to. But all external forms of religion are forms of comfort,
and men take vows of abstinence in the same spirit that they take
pledges of boon companionship. The difference between these two
sides of life is only apparent. But the homelessness which is demanded
of the neophyte is a much more vital thing than this. It
demands the surrender from him of choice or desire. Dwelling with
wife and child, under the shelter of a familiar roof-tree, and fulfilling
the duties of citizenship, the neophyte may be far more homeless,
in the esoteric sense, than when he is a wanderer or an outcast. The
first lesson in practical occultism usually given to a pledged disciple
is that of fulfilling the duties immediately to hand with the same
subtle mixture of enthusiasm and indifference as the neophyte would
imagine himself able to feel when he had grown to the size of a ruler
of worlds and a designer of destinies. This rule is to be found in the
Gospels and in the Bhagavad Gita. The immediate work, whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>it may be, has the abstract claim of duty, and its relative importance
or non-importance is not to be considered at all. This law can never
be obeyed until all desire of comfort is for ever destroyed. The
ceaseless assertions and re-assertions of the personal self must be
left behind for ever. They belong as completely to the character
of this world as does the desire to have a certain balance at the bank,
or to retain the affections of a loved person. They are equally subject
to the change which is characteristic of this world; indeed, they are
even more so, for what the neophyte does by becoming a neophyte
is simply to enter a forcing-house. Change, disillusionment, disheartenment,
despair will crowd upon him by invitation; for his wish is to
learn his lessons quickly. And as he turns these evils out they will
probably be replaced by others worse than themselves—a passionate
longing for separate life, for sensation, for the consciousness of growth
in his own self, will rush in upon him and sweep over the frail barriers
which he has raised. And no such barriers as asceticism, as renunciation,
nothing indeed which is negative, will stand for a single moment against
this powerful tide of feeling. The only barrier is built up of new
desires. For it is perfectly useless for the neophyte to imagine he can
get beyond the region of desires. He cannot; he is still a man,
Nature must bring forth flowers while she is still Nature, and the human
spirit would loose its hold on this form of existence altogether did it not
continue to desire. The individual man cannot wrench himself instantly
out of that life of which he is an essential part. He can only change
his position in it. The man whose intellectual life dominates his animal
life, changes his position; but he is still in the dominion of desire. The
disciple who believes it possible to become selfless in a single effort, will
find himself flung into a bottomless pit as the consequence of his rash
endeavour. Seize upon a new order of desires, purer, wider, nobler; and
so plant your foot upon the ladder firmly. It is only on the last and
topmost rung of the ladder, at the very entrance upon Divine or
Mahatmic life, that it is possible to hold fast to that which has neither
substance or existence.</p>

<p class='c028'>The first part of “Light on the Path” is like a chord in music; the
notes have to be struck together though they must be touched
separately. Study and seize hold of the new desires before you have
thrust out the old ones; otherwise in the storm you will be lost. Man
while he is man has substance and needs some step to stand on, some
idea to cling to. But let it be the least possible. Learn as the
acrobat learns, slowly and with care, to become more independent.
Before you attempt to cast out the devil of ambition—the desire of
something, however fine and elevated, outside of yourself,—seize on the
desire to find the light of the world within yourself. Before you attempt
to cast out the desire of conscious life, learn to look to the unattainable
or in other language to that which you know you can only reach in unconsciousness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>In knowing that your aim is of this lofty character, that
it will never bring conscious success, never bring comfort to you, that it
will never carry you <em>in your own temporary personal self</em> to any haven of
rest or place of agreeable activity, you cut away all the force and power
of the desires of the lower astral nature. For what avail is it, when
these facts have been once realised, to desire separateness, sensation or
growth?</p>

<p class='c028'>The armour of the warrior who rises to fight for you in the battle
depicted in the second part of “Light on the Path,” is like the shirt of
the happy man in the old story. The king was to be cured of all his
ills by sleeping in this shirt; but when the one happy man in his
kingdom was found, he was a beggar, without care, without anxiety—and
shirtless. So with the divine warrior. None can take his armour and
use it, for he has none. The king could never find happiness like that
of the careless beggar. The man of the world, however fine and
cultivated he may be, is hampered by a thousand thoughts and feelings
which have to be cast aside before he can even stand on the threshold of
occultism. And, be it observed, he is chiefly handicapped by the
armour he wears, which isolates him. He has personal pride, personal
respect. These things must die out as the personality recedes. The
process described in the first part of “Light on the Path,” is one which
takes off that shell, or armour, and casts it aside for ever. Then the
warrior arises, armourless, defenceless, offenceless, identified with the
afflicters and the afflicted, the angered and the one that angers; fighting
not on any side, but for the Divine, the highest in all.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>THE RELATION OF COLOUR TO THE INTERLACED <br /> TRIANGLES, OR THE PENTACLE.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c013'><sup>[166]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c035'>Colour registers grades of vibration. Vibration registers grades
of life. Life, esoterically considered, is ascent towards its source—the
great First Cause, the celestial sun which lights universal
creation.</p>

<p class='c028'>If a ray of white light is passed through a triangular piece of
glass, called a prism, it becomes separated into the seven colours known
as the “solar spectrum.” Careful scientific analysis has proven that
these colours are produced by different rates of vibration.</p>

<p class='c028'>It has shown that the slowest vibrations are red, the quickest <a id='corr481.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='violet'>violet.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_481.10'><ins class='correction' title='violet'>violet.</ins></a></span>
The red ray of the spectrum gives 477 millions of millions (or billions)
of vibrations in a second, the orange 506, the yellow 535, the green 577,
the blue 622, Indigo 658, and violet 699.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus there is a regular ascent in the colour-scale from red to violet, and
the trans-violet rays go on octaves higher, becoming invisible to the
physical eye as their rates of vibration increase.</p>

<p class='c028'>It has also been discovered that these seven prismatic rays of the
solar spectrum correspond to the seven notes on the musical scale, the
ray of slowest vibration, red, being a correlate of the base note of the
musical gamut, and the violet ray answering to the highest musical
note.</p>

<p class='c028'>When the vibrations exceed a certain limit, the tympanum of the ear
has not time to recoil before a succeeding impulse arrives, and it remains
motionless. Darkness and silence are, therefore, equivalents for the
cessation of vibrations on the retina of the eye and tympanum of the
ear respectively. Incidentally it may be stated that cold is also
considered to be the cessation of vibrations through the nerves of
feeling.</p>

<p class='c028'>Colour, therefore, is to light what pitch is to sound—both depend on
length of vibrations.</p>

<p class='c028'>The thought will immediately suggest itself in this connection that
if colour and music are thus correlated, the perfect clairvoyant might <em>see</em>
a concert as well as hear it. This is true, and there are instances on
record of such transcendent views. In one case of this kind, it was not
alone a poetical play of colour springing into life under the touch of a
German professor’s hands, but a host of airy sprites clothed in the
various rays which called them forth.</p>

<p class='c028'><em>Isis</em> declares that “sounds and colours are all spiritual numerals; and
as the seven prismatic rays proceed from one spot in Heaven, so the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>seven powers of Nature, each of them a number, are the seven radiations
of the unity, the central spiritual sun.”<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c013'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>It is easy to follow along the lines of these suggestions, and trace the
origin of chanting the seven vowels to one of their gods, among the
Egyptians, as a hymn of praise at sunrise. In the so-called mythical
Golden Age this must have been the mode of putting themselves <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en
rapport</i></span> or <em>in tune</em> with the Cosmic powers, and ensuring harmony while
the vibrations were synchronous.</p>

<p class='c028'>The third necessary correlation to be considered in this analysis is
that of form. Scientific research has proven that not only are music
and colour due to rates of vibration, but form also marshals itself into
objective being in obedience to the same mysterious law. This is
demonstrated by the familiar experiment of placing some dry sand on
a square of glass, and drawing a violin bow across the edge. Under the
influence of this intonation, the sand assumes star shapes of perfect
proportion; if other material is placed on the square of glass at the
same time, other shapes are assumed, varying in proportion to the power
resident in the atoms to <em>respond</em> to the vibrations communicated.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is noticeable, however, that the vibration makes the spaces, and the
sand falls into the <em>rest</em> places.</p>

<p class='c028'>We have now discovered a triangular key—light, music, form—which
will disclose to us the exact relations which colour sustains to the
interlaced triangles, the six-rayed star, universal symbol of creative
force acting upon matter.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c013'><sup>[168]</sup></a> This triangular key is simply three modes of
one being, three differential expressions of one force—vibration.</p>

<p class='c028'>That which causes the vibration we can only represent by the
Ineffable Name, behind which burns the quenchless glory of En Soph,
the Boundless.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus, in our symbology we start from the centre of a circle, which
should be represented by white light.</p>

<p class='c028'>The seven rays issuing therefrom, must first pass through the interior
and invisible triangle of Akasa, the prism A.U.M., before they can flow
outward, and by their action upon chaos, wheel the myriad forms of
physical life into consonance with their rates of vibration. In this
manner is the visible formulated from the invisible. By such subtle
music is born the gorgeous flora of our tropics, drinking its wealth of
colour from the yellow and warm rays of the sunlight; and in accord
with the same harmony is produced the subdued vegetation of colder
climes. The blue and violet beams carry the quick pulses of the parent
flame deep within the earth, and by-and-bye she gives back that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>she has received, transformed into a thousand brilliant hues woven in
the magic loom of Love, presided over by the solar spectrum. Or, as
Egyptian myth phrases it, Osiris (the sun) weds Isis (the earth), and
the child, Horus-Apollo, glorifies all things as the product of this
divine union.</p>

<p class='c028'>The culmination of light resides in the yellow ray, and hence to that
colour is given the East point in our symbolised centre of radiation.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c013'><sup>[169]</sup></a>
The others follow in the order of the solar spectrum.</p>

<p class='c028'>But it is noticeable in this connection, that <em>in</em> that order, the coarsest
and warmest of the visible rays—red—is placed next to the coldest and
most refined ray, the violet. Here we have the analogy of contraries.
The ray of lowest refrangibility and the ray of highest refrangibility
become next-door neighbours in the divergent circle of necessity. What
is the result? It is not hard to discover, when we know that the cooling
colours are essential to the balanced action of the thermal rays. “A
small amount of blue when combined with other rays will even increase
the heat, because it kindles into activity its opposite warm principle, red,
through chemical affinity.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Having determined the law which should govern the symbology of
colours at the centre of our circle, we come next to the interlaced
triangles.</p>

<p class='c028'>The truly Theosophical Pentacle should be made by the interlacing of
a white triangle with a black triangle—the white representing pure
spirit, the black, gross matter. This is the true symbology, for the reason
that white reflects all colours, and black absorbs all colours. It is the
face of the White Ancient looking into the face of the Black
Ancient.</p>

<p class='c028'>Absolute blackness appears to give back nothing; nor does it ever,
save through processes of slow evolution, wrought by continued vibration
upon its molecules from the Divine Centre of Light.</p>

<p class='c028'>Continuous vibration polarizes these particles, so that at last rising
from the lowest grade of refrangibility to the highest, into the invisible
octaves of being, our planetary chain in its culmination will reach a
point where every atom will give an answering thrill of resonance to the
throbbing of the heart of the Universe—the Central Spiritual Sun.</p>

<p class='c028'>As every substance in Nature has its colour, so the human family
publish their grades of advancement to the clairvoyant eye by their
astral colours; and seekers after the true Light may know what “ray”
they are in, by a comparison of their own auras with the colours of the
overshadowing soul.</p>

<p class='c028'>The middle rays of the solar spectrum—blue, green, and yellow—give
a very powerful triangle, a wonderful <em>working</em> triangle of forces; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>green is Hermetic silver, yellow is Hermetic gold, and blue is a despatch-messenger
from the “Lord of the Worlds,” Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c028'>The blue and the yellow of this group, on account of their position—the
third and the fifth reckoned both ways—have been chosen as the
colours of our incense-holders, alternating on the points of the Pentacle.
As odours are also correlated with colours, and as sandal-wood is the
perfume which belongs to the sun, we use that incense to intensify the
vibrations from the radiating points, in order to increase the volume of
accord which will reach other centres at a distance; for the akasa is
more sensitive than an Eolian harp—it registers the very <a id='corr484.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='arôma'>aroma</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_484.10'><ins class='correction' title='arôma'>aroma</ins></a></span> of our
thoughts. It was, therefore, no exaggeration of the poet when he
said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Guard well thy thought:</div>
      <div class='line'>Our thoughts are <em>heard</em> in Heaven.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>But if colours and sounds are spiritual numerals, then the seven
symbolical points of the Pentacle represent numbers of the greatest
importance in world-building, and in soul-building also. For we must
all build our own souls. And the symbology of the interlacing of the
triangle of spirit with the triangle of matter, finds its correspondence in
man, the little world, who, though a spiritual ego, yet dwells in a physical
house, and whose business it is to merge himself completely into the
region of the white triangle.</p>

<p class='c028'>When Man has raised his vibrations into perfect harmony with the
universal sun, he has then unbound himself from the wheel of re-birth—the
Zodiac—and is ready to enter Nirvana.</p>

<p class='c028'>The word “heaven” in Hebrew signifies the abode of the sun. When,
therefore, the Nazarene said “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,”
he virtually declared that all the seven cosmic powers are resident
within us.</p>

<p class='c028'>Esoteric science recognises man as a septenary, working in conjunction
with other orders of numerals which register divine vibrations.</p>

<p class='c028'>All nature listens to that universal song, and the music of the spheres is
no fable. The swarming zöospores in the protoplasm of plants hear it, and
thrilled by that enchantment, fall into invisible rhythm, bringing up by quick
marches into the region of Day the tiny dwellers in stem and leaf. How do
we know that the mystery of the six-sided cell of the honey-bee may not
find its solution here? Perhaps the bee is susceptible only to vibrations
which fall into these lines, and faithfully obeys the master-musician in
the construction of its hexagonal house. The great law of cosmic and
microcosmic correspondence was revealed ages ago to the Sages who
<em>listened</em>, and listening, <em>heard</em> the wondrous revelations breathed forth
from the harp of Akasa. Sighing winds from other worlds passed over
the delicate strings, and as they passed, uttered in soundless tones the
profound mystery of near and remote planets. These Sages dwelt in
that White Palace—the Lotus of the Heart—the sun-palace indeed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>From centre to circumference their vast circle of vision was permeated
by the reflected <em>All</em>, and from the White Palace they ascended the
sacred mountain Meru, where dwelleth wisdom and love.</p>

<p class='c028'>The key which opens the White Palace is held by the seven mystic
children of the Royal Arch of the Rainbow, guarding the seven gates of
the Sun, every gate of which answers to a musical note, and every note
of which enfolds three tones.</p>

<p class='c028'>Hence, if we understand the analogies of colour, we may open the six
doors of Nature, and also the seventh, to Nirvana.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>A THEORY OF HAUNTINGS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c033'>Very few persons realise the powerful and long-lasting effects of
human “auras”—those mysterious psychical emanations which
are mentally cognised, and which silently impress one as to the
character of a locality, the <a id='corr486.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='indiosyncrasies'>idiosyncrasies</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_486.5'><ins class='correction' title='indiosyncrasies'>idiosyncrasies</ins></a></span> of a nation, a family, or an
individual. Personal auras are strictly speaking the effects of the innate,
and presumably hidden natures, of individuals, and are entirely
the effluence of soul and mind. A house, or a neighbourhood, becomes
imbued with the individual or collective auras of its inhabitants, which
convey to the psychic senses, and thence to the mind, a powerful impression
of character. At the same time within the aura of individuals,
or families, are indelibly imprinted their thought-pictures, which may,
or may not, have been embodied in acts; the faces and forms of
relatives, friends, visitors, of the very animals they pet, the image of
their pursuits, in short the whole life. These are imprinted in the
<em>astral</em> element which surrounds each individual soul, as the atmosphere
surrounds our bodies; and as the air we breathe becomes changed in
respiration, so this ethereal atmosphere becomes transformed by personal
impress.</p>

<p class='c028'>Education, morality, religion, health, disease, happiness or misery, are
largely the effects of the widely diffused auras of individuals continually
given forth into the ambient atmosphere. As a man, or body of men,
think, act, and live, such is the quality of the aura, or odylic sphere they
emanate. This has an effect for good or evil upon all who approach
within its radius; a formative, educating effect upon the ignorant, if it is
of a high, intellectual, or spiritual quality; or a depressing, stultifying,
deforming effect upon the minds and souls of innocent, or negative
sensitives, when it is of an impure, debased, or brutal character.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thought governs the world. It is by thought, and its embodiment in
acts, that progress is made. Every thought has its aura, and nothing
can prevent its diffusion in the atmospheres, both the astral and the
natural or physical. Hence being continually surrounded by the effects
of thoughts universally diffused, we are insensibly governed by their
aura of good or evil, and we grow in beauty, or are warped in deformity,
mental and bodily, from infancy, under the moulding consequences of
the local thought-auras of the family, neighbourhood and nation in which
we happen to be born.</p>

<p class='c028'>Psychometry proves that even stones retain the impression of the
scenes which have been enacted in their neighbourhood. That is, the
stone having been bathed in the psychic emanations of creatures, human
and animal, during, perhaps, centuries, retains such auras indestructibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>in its atmosphere; and a psychometric clairvoyant will gradually
perceive the most trivial details of the more active life which has daily
passed in the vicinity of the stone. A fragment from the Temple of
Diana of Ephesus, for instance, were it procurable, would enable a good
psychometrist to describe every minute particular of the ancient temple
worship and ceremonies. A stone from the Colosseum held in the hand,
or to the forehead of a psychometrist, would produce a vision of the
scenes in the arena which were wont to attract the Roman population.
A fossil of some antediluvian animal would bring before the mind’s eye
surroundings corresponding to the period in which the animal had lived.
In truth, upon the plane of more ethereal matter adjacent to this, are
to be found the images of all things, subject neither to time nor the
changes of time; and there our image-producing faculties, temporarily
divested of the blinding veil of flesh, may call them up at will.</p>

<p class='c028'>The aura of a great crime becomes diffused in the neighbourhood of
its commission, and concealment would be impossible if the psychic
vision of men were open instead of being closed. A picture of the deed
committed becomes impressed upon the astral atmosphere, with the faces
and forms of those engaged in its commission. This effect is never
destroyed, but may be recalled at will by a good clairvoyante. At the
same time the aura of good deeds is equally powerful and indestructible.
The one is like a transitory convulsion, disturbing the beauty of order
and harmony with Nature; the other is the fixed and equable moral
atmosphere arising from thoughts and actions consonant with wisdom.
In short, the aura of good thoughts and deeds is the <em>pabulum</em> of souls;
the invigorating and supporting air they inspire and respire, producing
health, happiness, mental activity, and inciting to progress. If it were
not for the good on the earth, we might doubtless often cry in vain—“Heaven
help us!”—for we should be so smothered under evil auras
that spiritual breathing, and rapport with purer realms of life, would be
a radical impossibility.</p>

<p class='c028'>A crime is the insane product of an unbalanced, disordered mind. It
causes a species of astral electric disturbance, which is as sensibly felt by
sensitives as any explosion or convulsion on the natural plane. Astral,
or ethereal molecules become violently displaced, and forced into new
conditions of juxtaposition. A mysterious terror pervades the air, which
affects all neighbouring minds, even to the very animals. It is as if the
living soul of Nature had been violently wrenched from its normal condition
of peace and happiness, and stood electrified with horror, whilst
upon its veil of ethereal matter is fixed an indestructible image of the
painful tragedy which has been suddenly enacted.</p>

<p class='c028'>We are, in fact, surrounded, upon the soul plane of life, by an
atmosphere which receives, so to speak, a photographic impression of
even our very thoughts, which is a mirror to reflect our whole life, an
image-world, retaining sounds as well as forms. It may be made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>subject to our will, which can call up before the mind, and make visible
to the eye of the soul whatsoever, without exception, we will to see, to
hear, or to know. The phantoms or apparitions of which we so frequently
hear, are matters of fact to all psychic seers; are things as
absolutely existent as any objects on the more familiar plane of dense
matter. Once to realise this great fact, and to understand some of the
laws which would enable us consciously to control, and illustrate to our
satisfaction, certain of the hidden mysteries of the inner world of
ethereal matter, from which our own proceeds as an effect from a cause,
would set us upon a mountain height of knowledge whence all clouds
of superstition, doubt, and uncertainty, would roll away.</p>

<p class='c028'>There are many stories extant of certain haunting apparitions which
have been seen at various times during the lapse of centuries, reappearing
again and again in the same families as warnings, or otherwise; or
it may be a mysterious sound, such as the cry of the “banshee” in
Ireland. The popular fallacy regarding such apparitions is that a <em>human</em>
soul, or “spirit”—it may be wrongly called—is compelled, as a retribution
for the commission of some crime, to remain on the earth haunting
the scene of its former sins. Or, if the visitant be a benevolent ghost,
it is supposed that it is some ancestor or ancestress, ever present in
loving watchfulness over the destinies of the family, giving warning
of death or danger. The idea of a human soul being chained in this
melancholy fashion to the earth is exceedingly repugnant to most
minds, and naturally excites the utmost compassion for the poor ghost
which has to wear out so dreary a doom. Such a hypothesis contradicts
all those religious teachings which assign to souls either a state
of absolute unconscious sleep, until the day of judgment, or an abode,
presumably in a conscious state, in heaven or hell. It contradicts all
those more modern teachings of “progress” after death, of the gradual
ascension of the soul to its place of rest. If we accept the ideas of
Eastern teachers concerning those occult mysteries—that the higher
self, the spiritualised entity, gradually separates from its more animal,
or lower principles of organism, which adhere together for a longer or
shorter period as a shell-like or shadowy personality—even then, these
principles or ethereal molecules which go to form an astral body, disintegrate
after a time. They would not be likely, at all events, to
endure over a century. Apparitions of persons deceased <em>within</em> a
century might be considered as essentially ghosts, or shades—the
shadowy, sidereal shapes of personalities passed away from the physical
plane, and in a condition of gradual separation from all that can attach
them to the earth. And it is presumable that a phantom which is seen
repeatedly during the lapse of centuries, is merely a reflection in the
astral light, called up by the will of a seer; or projected upon the plane
of soul-vision either by some psychological disturbance, or by some
change of condition on the part of those who see the phantom. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>immediate action may be due to “<em>elementals</em>,” those mysterious entities
called by Liebnitz “Monads,” which are in close attendance upon
mankind, and have so much to do with his very existence that he would
fare but indifferently without them. Not only are they as intimately
consociated with him as his own thoughts, but certain grades of them
depend upon him also for their existence. These beings often become
tutelary, or “house-spirits,” and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> of re-appearing again and
again, as a sort of hereditary ghost, to give warning of death or danger,
is not incompatible with their condition of existence. Time does not
exist for them, and one century would be like any other. They live
in the personal or family aura, and become intimately blended with the
daily lives of its members. When, as in the case of royal or noble
houses, the family aura remains undisturbed in its ancient palaces or
castles during centuries, a haunting elemental would find it an easy
matter to make itself visible, frequently by a semi-materialisation, or a
condensation of the ethereal atoms of its body. In such a case it would
be seen objectively by anyone who happened to be present. In other
cases, when an apparition is only a reflection in the astral light, a
sensitive in moments of abnormal or psychic lucidity would perceive
it. Others sympathetically inclined would perceive the same. At
length, after repeated similar visions, the locality would get the name
of being haunted. The image so repeatedly beheld becomes fixed in
the atmosphere of that particular spot. Upon entering a locality with
such a reputation a species of psychological inebriation would assail
every individual so constituted as to fall under the effects of the aura
already established, and they would then always behold the spectre thus
ideally produced. These mental or astral spectres need not necessarily
be merely immovable pictures. They will move, or walk, threaten, or
act a pantomime exactly as they may have the reputation of doing; or
as the person who beholds them expects or imagines them to be doing.</p>

<p class='c028'>In some respects these apparitions or warning cries may be mental
legacies left indelibly impressed in the astral light by the powerful will
of a departed ancestor, friendly or inimical, as a blessing or a curse;
or even by a member of some alien family, as a pursuing Nemesis which
falls as a retribution upon the perpetrator of evil, but can possess no
power over the innocent and good.</p>

<p class='c032'>No one can be regarded as a Christian unless he professes, or is supposed
to profess, belief in Jesus, by baptism, and in salvation, “through the
blood of Christ.” To be considered a good Christian, one has, as a
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>conditio sine quâ non</i></span>, to show faith in the dogmas expounded by the Church
and to profess them; after which a man is at liberty to lead a private and
public life on principles diametrically opposite to those expressed in the
Sermon on the Mount. The chief point and that which is demanded of him
is, that he should have—or <em>pretend to have</em>—a blind faith in, and veneration for,
the ecclesiastical teachings of his special Church.</p>

make it, in St. Mark’s Gospel, Chapter xvi., verse 16th: “He that believeth
and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”</p>

<p class='c028'>It troubles the Church very little that the most careful search for these words
in the oldest texts during the last centuries, remained fruitless; or, that the
recent revision of the Bible led to a unanimous conviction in the truth-seeking
and truth-loving scholars employed in that task, that no such <em>un-Christ</em>-like
sentence was to be found, except in some of the latest, fraudulent texts.
The good Christian people had assimilated the consoling words, and they had
become the very pith and marrow of their charitable souls. To take away the
hope of eternal damnation, for all others except themselves, from these chosen
vessels of the God of Israel, was like taking their very life. The truth-loving
and God-fearing revisers got scared; they left the forged passage (an interpolation
of eleven verses, from the 9th to the 20th), and satisfied their consciences
with a foot-note remark of a very equivocal character, one that would grace
the work and do honour to the diplomatic faculties of the craftiest Jesuits.
It tells the “believer” that:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The two oldest Greek MSS. and some other authorities <span class='fss'>OMIT</span> from verse 9 to the end. Some
authorities <em>have a different ending</em> to the Gospel.”<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c013'><sup>[170]</sup></a>—</p>

</div>

<p class='c041'>—and explains no further.</p>

<p class='c028'>But the two “oldest Greek MSS.” <em>omit</em> the verses <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>nolens volens</i></span>, as these <em>have
never existed</em>. And the learned and truth-loving revisers know this better than
any of us do; yet the wicked falsehood is printed at the very seat of Protestant
Divinity, and it is allowed to go on, glaring into the faces of coming generations
of students of theology and, hence, into those of their future parishioners.
Neither can be, nor are they deceived by it, yet both <em>pretend</em> belief
in the authenticity of the cruel words worthy of a <em>theological Satan</em>. And this
Satan-Moloch is their own <em>God of infinite mercy and justice</em> in Heaven, and the
incarnate symbol of love and charity on Earth—blended in one!</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>Truly mysterious are your paradoxical ways, oh—Churches of Christ!</p>

<p class='c028'>I have no intention of repeating here stale arguments and logical <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>exposés</i></span> of
the whole theological scheme; for all this has been done, over and over again,
and in a most excellent way, by the ablest “Infidels” of England and America.
But I may briefly repeat a prophecy which is a self-evident result of the present
state of men’s minds in Christendom. Belief in the Bible <em>literally</em>, and in a
<em>carnalised</em> Christ, will not last a quarter of a century longer. The Churches
will have to part with their cherished dogmas, or the 20th century will witness
the downfall and ruin of all Christendom, and with it, belief even in a
Christos, as pure Spirit. The very name has now become obnoxious, and
theological Christianity must die out, <em>never to resurrect again</em> in its present form.
This, in itself, would be the happiest solution of all, were there no danger from
the natural reaction which is sure to follow: crass materialism will be the
consequence and the result of centuries of blind faith, unless the loss of old
ideals is replaced by other ideals, unassailable, because <em>universal</em>, and built on
the rock of eternal truths instead of the shifting sands of human fancy. Pure
immateriality must replace, in the end, the terrible anthropomorphism of those
ideals in the conceptions of our modern dogmatists. Otherwise, why should
Christian dogmas—the perfect counterpart of those belonging to other exoteric
and pagan religions—claim any superiority? The bodies of all these were
built upon the same astronomical and physiological (or phallic) symbols.
Astrologically, every religious dogma the world over, may be traced to, and
located in, the Zodiacal signs and the Sun. And so long as the science of
comparative symbology or any theology has only two keys to open the
mysteries of religious dogmas—and these two only very partially mastered,
how can a line of demarcation be drawn, or any difference made between the
religions of say, Chrishna and Christ, between salvation through the blood of the
“first-born primeval male” of one faith, and that of the “only <em>begotten</em> Son”
of the other, far younger, religion?</p>

<p class='c028'>Study the Vedas; read even the superficial, often disfigured writings of our
great Orientalists, and think over what you will have learnt. Behold Brahmans,
Egyptian Hierophants, and Chaldean Magi, teaching several thousand years
before our era that the gods themselves had been only mortals (in previous
births) until they won their immortality by <em>offering their blood to their Supreme
God</em> or chief. The “Book of the Dead,” teaches that mortal man “became
one with the gods through an interflow of a common life in the common blood
of the two.” Mortals gave the blood of their first-born sons in sacrifice to the
Gods. In his <cite>Hinduism</cite>, p. 35, Professor Monier Williams, translating from
the <cite>Taitiriya Brâhmana</cite>, writes:—“By means of the sacrifice the gods obtained
heaven.” And in the <cite>Tandya Brâhmana</cite>:—“The lord of creatures offered
himself a sacrifice for the gods.”... And again in the <cite>Satapatha Brâhmana</cite>:—“He
who, knowing this, sacrifices with the <em>Purusha-madha</em> or the sacrifice of
the primeval male, becomes everything.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Whenever I hear the Vedic rites discussed and called “disgusting human
sacrifices,” and cannibalism (<i>sic.</i>), I feel always inclined to ask, where’s the
difference? Yet there is one, in fact; for while Christians are compelled to accept
the allegorical (though, when understood, highly philosophical) drama of the New
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>Testament Crucifixion, as that of Abraham and Isaac literally,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c013'><sup>[171]</sup></a> Brahmanism—its
philosophical schools at any rate—teaches its adherents, that this (<em>pagan</em>)
sacrifice of the “primeval male” is a purely allegorical and philosophical
symbol. Read in their dead-letter meaning, the four gospels are simply slightly
altered versions of what the Church proclaims as Satanic plagiarisms (by anticipation)
of Christian dogmas in Pagan religions. Materialism has a perfect
right to find in all of them the same sensual worship and “solar” myths as
anywhere else. Analysed and criticised superficially and on its dead-letter face,
Professor Joly (“Man before Metals,” pp. 189-190) finding in the <em>Swastika</em>, the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>crux ansata</i></span>, and the cross pure and simple, mere sexual symbols—is justified in
speaking as he does. Seeing that “the father of the sacred fire (in India) bore
the name of <em>Twashtri</em>, that is the divine carpenter who made the <em>Swastika</em>
and the <em>Pramantha</em>, whose friction produced the divine child <em>Agni</em>, in Latin
<em>Ignis</em>; that his mother was named <em>Maya</em>; he himself, styled <em>Akta</em> (<em>anointed</em>,
or <em>Christos</em>) after the priests had poured upon his head the spirituous <em>soma</em>
and on his body butter purified by sacrifice”; seeing all this he has a full right
to remark that:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“The close resemblance which exists between certain ceremonies of the worship of <em>Agni</em> and certain
rites of the Catholic religion may be explained by their common origin. <em>Agni</em> in the condition of
<em>Akta</em>, or anointed, is suggestive of Christ; <em>Maya</em>, Mary, his mother; <em>Twashtri</em>, St. Joseph, the
carpenter of the Bible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Has the professor of the Science Faculty of Toulouse explained anything by
drawing attention to that which anyone can see? Of course not. But if, in
his ignorance of the esoteric meaning of the allegory he has added nothing to
human knowledge, he has on the other hand destroyed faith in many of his
pupils in both the “<em>divine</em> origin” of Christianity and its Church and helped to
increase the number of Materialists. For surely, no man, once he devotes
himself to such comparative studies, can regard the religion of the West in any
light but that of a pale and enfeebled copy of older and nobler philosophies.</p>

<p class='c028'>The origin of all religions—Judaeo-Christianity included—is to be found in
a few primeval truths, not one of which can be explained apart from all the
others, as each is a complement of the rest in some one detail. And they are
all, more or less, broken rays of the same Sun of truth, and their beginnings
have to be sought in the archaic records of the Wisdom-religion. Without the
light of the latter, the greatest scholars can see but the skeletons thereof covered
with masks of fancy, and based mostly on personified Zodiacal signs.</p>

<p class='c028'>A thick film of allegory and <em>blinds</em>, the “dark sayings” of fiction and parable,
thus covers the original esoteric texts from which the New Testament—<em>as now
known</em>—was compiled. Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth?
Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, <em>mortal</em> brain could have
invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on
Calvary? We say, on the authority of the esoteric Eastern School, that all this
came from the Gnostics, as far as the name Christos and the astronomico-mystical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient <em>Tanaïm</em> as
regards the Kabalistic connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications.
One of these is the mystic esoteric name of Jehovah—not the present
fanciful God of the profane Jews ignorant of their own mysteries, the God
accepted by the still more ignorant Christians—but the compound Jehovah of
the pagan Initiation. This is proven very plainly by the glyphs or mystic
combinations of various signs which have survived to this day in the Roman
Catholic hieroglyphics.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Gnostic Records contained the epitome of the chief scenes enacted
during the mysteries of Initiation, since the memory of man; though even that
was given out invariably under the garb of semi-allegory, whenever entrusted to
parchment or paper. But the ancient Tanaïm, the Initiates from whom the
wisdom of the Kabala (<em>oral tradition</em>) was obtained by the later Talmudists,
had in their possession the secrets of the mystery language, and it is <em>in this
language that the Gospels</em> were written.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c013'><sup>[172]</sup></a> He alone who has mastered the
esoteric cypher of antiquity—the secret meaning of the numerals, a common
property at one time of all nations—has the full proof of the genius which was
displayed in the blending of the purely Egypto-Jewish, Old Testament allegories
and names, and those of the pagan-Greek Gnostics, the most refined of all the
mystics of that day. Bishop Newton proves it himself quite innocently, by
showing that “St. Barnabas, the companion of St. Paul, in his epistle (ch. ix.)
discovers ... the name of Jesus crucified in the number 318,” namely, Barnabas
finds it in the mystic Greek I H T—the <em>tau</em> being the glyph of the cross. On
this, a Kabalist, the author of an unpublished MS. on the Key of Formation
of the Mystery Language, observes:—“But this is but a play upon the Hebrew
letters <em>Jodh</em>, <em>Chith</em>, and <em>Shin</em>, from whence the I H S as the monogram of
Christ coming down to our day, and this reads as יהש or 381, the sum of
the letters being 318 or the number of Abraham and his Satan, and of Joshua
and his Amalek ... also the number of Jacob and his antagonist ...
(Godfrey Higgins gives the authority for the number 608).... It is the
number of Melchizedek’s name, for the value of the last is 304 and Melchizedek
was the priest of the most high God, without beginning nor ending of days.”
The solution and secret of Melchizedek are found in the fact that “in the
ancient Pantheons the two planets which had existed from eternity (<em>æonic</em>
eternity) and were eternal, were the Sun and the Moon, or Osiris and Isis,
hence the terms of <em>without beginning nor ending of days</em>. 304 multiplied by
two is 608. So also the numbers in the word Seth, who was a type of the year.
There are a number of authorities for the number 888 as applying to the name
of Jesus Christ, and as said this is in antagonism to the 666 of the Anti-Christ....
The staple value in the name of Joshua was the number 365, the
indication of the Solar year, while Jehovah delighted in being the indication of
the Lunar year—and Jesus Christ was both Joshua and Jehovah in the
Christian Pantheon....”</p>

<p class='c028'>This is but an illustration to our point to prove that the Christian application
of the compound name Jesus-Christ is all based on Gnostic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Eastern mysticism. It was only right and natural that Chroniclers like the
initiated Gnostics, pledged to secresy, should veil or <em>cloak</em> the final meaning of
their oldest and most sacred teachings. The right of the Church fathers to
cover the whole with an epitheme of euhemerized fancy is rather more
dubious.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c013'><sup>[173]</sup></a> The Gnostic Scribe and Chronicler deceived no one. Every
Initiate into the Archaic gnosis—whether of the pre-Christian or post-Christian
period—knew well the value of every word of the “mystery-language.”
For these Gnostics—the inspirers of primitive Christianity—were “the most
cultured, the most learned and most wealthy of the Christian name,” as Gibbon
has it. Neither they, nor their humbler followers, were in danger of accepting
the dead letter of their own texts. But it was different with the victims of
the fabricators of what is now called <em>orthodox</em> and <em>historic</em> Christianity. Their
successors have all been made to fall into the mistakes of the “foolish
Galatians” reproved by Paul, who, as he tells them (Galat. iii. 1-5), having
begun (by believing) in the Spirit (of Christos), “ended by believing in <em>the
flesh</em>,”—<i>i.e.</i>, a <em>corporeal</em> Christ. For such is the true meaning of the Greek
sentence,<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c013'><sup>[174]</sup></a> “ἐναρξάμενοι Πνεύματι νῦν σαρκι ἐπιτελεῖσθε.” That Paul
was a gnostic, a founder of a new sect of <em>gnosis</em> which recognized,
as all other gnostic sects did, a “Christ-Spirit,” though it went against its
opponents, the rival sects, is sufficiently clear to all but dogmatists and
theologians. Nor is it less clear that the primitive teachings of Jesus, whenever he
may have lived, could be discovered only in Gnostic teachings; against which
discovery, the falsifiers who dragged down Spirit into matter, thus degrading
the noble philosophy of primeval Wisdom-Religion, have taken ample
precautions from the first. The works of Basilides alone—“The philosopher
devoted to the contemplation of Divine things,” as Clement describes him—the
24 volumes of his <em>interpretations upon the Gospels</em>—were all burned by
order of the Church, Eusebius tells us (H. E., iv. 7).</p>

<p class='c028'>As these <cite>Interpretations</cite> were written at a time when the Gospels we have
now, were not yet in existence,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c013'><sup>[175]</sup></a> here is a good proof that the Evangel, the
doctrines of which were delivered to Basilides by the Apostle Matthew, and
Glaucus, the disciple of Peter (<cite>Clemens Al.</cite> “<cite>Strom.</cite>” vii. 7, § 106), must
have differed widely from the present New Testament Nor can these
doctrines be judged by the distorted accounts of them left to posterity by
Tertullian. Yet even the little this partisan fanatic gives, shows the chief gnostic
doctrines to be identical, under their own peculiar terminology and personations,
with those of the <em>Secret Doctrine</em> of the East. For, discussing Basilides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>the “pious, god-like, theosophic philosopher,” as Clement of Alexandria
thought him, Tertullian exclaims:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“After this, Basilides, the <em>heretic</em>, broke loose.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c013'><sup>[176]</sup></a> He asserted that there is a Supreme God, by
name Abraxas, by whom Mind (<em>Mahat</em>) was created, which the Greeks call <em>Nous</em>. From this
emanated the Word; from the Word, Providence; from Providence, Virtue and Wisdom; from
these two again, Virtues, <em>Principalities</em>,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c013'><sup>[177]</sup></a> <em>and Powers</em> were made; thence infinite productions and
emissions of angels. Among the lowest angels, indeed, and those that made this world, he sets
<em>last of all</em> the god of the Jews, whom he denies to be God himself, affirming that he is but one of the
angels.”<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c013'><sup>[178]</sup></a> (Isis Unv. vol. ii.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c028'>Another proof of the claim that the Gospel of Matthew in the usual Greek texts
is not the original gospel written in Hebrew, is given by no less an authority
than S. Jerome (or Hieronymus). The suspicion of a conscious and gradual
<em>euhemerization</em> of the Christ principle ever since the beginning, grows into a
conviction, once that one becomes acquainted with a certain confession contained
in book ii. of the “Comment. to Matthew” by Hieronymus. For we find in
it the proofs of a deliberate substitution of the whole gospel, the one now in the
Canon having been evidently re-written by this too zealous Church Father.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c013'><sup>[179]</sup></a>
He says that he was sent toward the close of the fourth century by “their
Felicities,” the Bishops Chromatius and Heliodorus to Cæsarea, with the
mission to compare the Greek text (the only one they ever had) with the Hebrew
original version preserved by the Nazarenes in their library, and to translate it.
He translated it, but under protest; for, as he says, the <em>Evangel</em> “exhibited
matter <em>not for edification, but for <a id='corr495.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='destruction.'>destruction.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_495.23'><ins class='correction' title='destruction.'>destruction.”</ins></a></span></em><a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c013'><sup>[180]</sup></a> The “destruction” of what?
Of the dogma that Jesus of Nazareth and the <em>Christos</em> are one—evidently; hence
for the “destruction” of the newly planned religion.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c013'><sup>[181]</sup></a> In this same letter the
Saint (who advised his converts to kill their fathers, trample on the bosom that
fed them, by walking over the bodies of their mothers, if the parents stood as
an obstacle between their sons and Christ)—admits that Matthew did not wish
his gospel to be <em>openly written</em>, hence that the MS. <em>was a secret</em> one. But
while admitting also that this gospel “was written in Hebrew characters and
<em>by the hand of himself</em>” (<cite>Matthew</cite>), yet in another place he contradicts
himself and assures posterity that <em>as it was tampered with, and re-written by a
disciple of Manicheus, named Seleucus</em> ... “the ears of the Church properly
refused to listen to it.” (<cite>Hieron.</cite>, “Comment. to Matthew,” book ii.
chapter xii., 13.)</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>No wonder that the very meaning of the terms <em>Chrestos</em> and <em>Christos</em>, and the
bearing of both on “Jesus of Nazareth,” a name coined out of Joshua the
<em>Nazar</em>, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian
Occultists. For even the Kabalists have no original data now to rely upon.
The <em>Zohar</em> and the Kabala have been remodelled by Christian hands out of
recognition; and were it not for a copy of the Chaldean <cite>Book of Numbers</cite> there
would remain no better than garbled accounts. Let not our Brothers, the
so-called Christian Kabalists of England and France, many of whom are
Theosophists, protest too vehemently; for <em>this is history</em> (See Munk). It is as
foolish to maintain, as some German Orientalists and modern critics still do,
that the Kabala has never existed before the day of the Spanish Jew, Moses de
Leon, accused of having forged this pseudograph in the 13th century, as to
claim that any of the Kabalistical works now in our possession are as original
as they were when Rabbi Simeon Ben Jochaï delivered the “traditions” to
his son and followers. Not a single of these books is immaculate, none has
escaped mutilation by Christian hands. Munk, one of the most learned and
able critics of his day on this subject, proves it, while protesting as we do, against
the assumption that it is a post-Christian forgery, for he says:</p>

<p class='c028'>“It appears evident to us that the author made use of ancient documents,
and among these of certain <em>Midraschim</em> or collections of traditions and Biblical
expositions, which we do not now possess.”</p>

<p class='c028'>After which, quoting from Tholuck (l. c. pp. 24 and 31), he adds:</p>

<p class='c028'>“Haya Gaon, who died in 1038, is to our knowledge the first author who
developed the theory of the Sephiroth and he gave to them the names which we
find again to be among the Kabalists (Tellenik, Moses ben Schem Tob di Leon,
p. 13, note 5); this doctor, <em>who had intimate intercourse with the Syrian and
Chaldean Christian savans</em>, was enabled by these last to acquire a knowledge of
some of the Gnostic writings.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Which “Gnostic writings” and esoteric tenets passed part and parcel into the
Kabalistic works, with many more modern interpolations that we now find in
the <em>Zohar</em>, as Munk well proves. The Kabala is Christian now, not Jewish.</p>

<p class='c028'>Thus, what with several generations of most active Church Fathers ever
working at the destruction of old documents and the preparation of new
passages to be interpolated in those which happened to survive, there remains of
the <em>Gnostics</em>—the legitimate offspring of the Archaic Wisdom-religion—but a
few unrecognisable shreds. But a particle of genuine gold will glitter for ever;
and, however garbled the accounts left by Tertullian and Epiphanius of the
Doctrines of the “Heretics,” an occultist can yet find even in them traces of
those primeval truths which were once universally imparted during the
mysteries of Initiation. Among other works with most suggestive allegories in
them, we have still the so-called <cite>Apocryphal Gospels</cite>, and the last discovered
as the most precious relic of Gnostic literature, a fragment called <em>Pistis-Sophia</em>,
“Knowledge-Wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c028'>In my next article upon the Esoteric character of the Gospels, I hope to be
able to demonstrate that those who translate <em>Pistis</em> by “Faith,” are utterly
wrong. The word “faith” as <em>grace</em> or something to be believed in through
unreasoned or blind faith, is a word that dates only since Christianity. Nor
has Paul ever used this term in this sense in his Epistles; and Paul was undeniably—an
<span class='sc'>Initiate</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>“SPIRIT REVEALED.”<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c013'><sup>[182]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c035'>The new work by Captain Serjeant (New Dispensationist and Fellow of the
Theosophical Society) is certainly what he describes it as being, the “book for
the age,” if, at least, it be admitted that the age requires arousing. I have no
hesitation in saying that no such book has before been presented to the public.
It sounds forth like a trumpet to arouse the sleepers from their crass forgetfulness
of every law of Brotherly Love and Spiritual Truth. One might almost
imagine, in reading it, the sensation produced upon his contemporaries by
Ezekiel, when first he gave forth his prophecies to a wondering world; or by
Bunyan, when he startled the English of his time with the magnificent allegory
of the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” It is true that here and there whole passages are
bodily transplanted from St John’s “Revelation,” but they are so marvellously
dovetailed into the context that, without constant reference to the Apocalypse,
it is almost impossible to say where the quotations begin and where they end.
From a literary point of view this may be a fault; but if we recognise the one
Spirit speaking through many voices we cannot deny that the same truth may
call for repetition and expansion, and the same Spirit may emit again, with
fuller details, what it has emitted before.</p>

<p class='c028'>Were this an <em>orthodox</em> journal, I am aware that I dare not advance such
tenets for fear the luckless editors should be deemed blasphemous by their
subscribers. But <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> at least must allow that the Universal Spirit has not
in the sacred books of olden times breathed its last words. Then, again,
Captain Serjeant disclaims all <em>personal</em> responsibility for these utterances when
he states that the very passages which the reader will find the most glowing
in the fierceness of their heat, are not words conceived by his own personality,
but given to him by processes well-known to Spiritualists as “direct” and
“automatic” writing.</p>

<p class='c028'>The root idea of the volume is that <em>one Spirit</em> permeates all men and all
things, and that this Spirit is that of Wisdom, Love and Truth; yet that this
Spirit is denied or hidden out of sight by its own children; and that not till it
is again made manifest in the public affairs of the world, can mankind hope for
that happiness which it is now vainly pursuing in every other direction save the
right one, namely, <em>within</em>. The dedication of the book sounds the key-note
of its contents; for it is inscribed to “Love, the Queen of Heaven; and to
Faith, the Star of the Soul.” The inscription closes with the words “Follow
after Love—Love never faileth,” and the reader is intentionally left to supply
the third term, “God is Love.” It is in this conception of the Supreme that
we shall find the whole meaning of the work. The words “God” and the
“Father,” as also the “Mother” and “Christ,” are employed pretty freely;
yet with this clue, we shall see that the writer believes in no <em>personal</em> Deity, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>in one Universal Spirit, of whom each intelligence is a manifestation in the
flesh, little though such being may show or know it.</p>

<p class='c028'>It is impossible in a short review to touch upon all the striking features of
“Spirit Revealed,” and I must, therefore, content myself with noticing but a
very few, referring the readers of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> to the book itself; for they will find
in it a “Guide, Philosopher and Friend.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The preface reminds one of a passage in Ezekiel too often forgotten. “And
they were <em>scattered</em>, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all
the beasts of the field, <em>when they were scattered</em>.” Captain Serjeant points
out the necessity of a bond of <em>union</em> in these words:—</p>

<p class='c028'>“The contentions amongst many religious sects have been to a considerable
extent responsible for the rise, growth, and development of numerous societies
of professed religious, as well as of an anti-religious character. Each and every
one of these Societies possesses its own peculiar views on the Deity, as well as
on life and death, and though the majority of the more enlightened of them
have evidently the same fundamental principles underlying the teachings which
they endeavour to inculcate in the minds of men generally, yet the manifest
confusion generated by what are seemingly conflicting opinions, tends, unhappily,
to increase the bewilderment and distrust experienced in connection with the
truths of the Spirit throughout all classes of Society in the nineteenth century.”</p>

<p class='c028'>He then proceeds to claim for his work that it “places in the hands of
Christian Ministers” (Note, that he employs the word “Christ” continually
in the sense of the divine Spirit within mankind) “many powerful weapons
wherewith to establish and uphold the universal Church of the Living God.”
The preface, which is conceived throughout in the most elevated style of
address, concludes with an appeal to “all who, in their hearts, are ready and
willing to labour loyally in the interests of their less enlightened fellow creatures
existing in this ignorant, selfish, and love-starved world.”</p>

<p class='c028'>After a brief Introduction, couched in a prophetic form, the writer deals with
the nature of God, man, matter, the power of Spirit manifest in and through
matter, the omnipresence of Spirit, the Intelligent Principle, and the Seven
Rays of Truth. In these seven chapters is comprised what I may call the
theoretical part of the book. The following quotations must suffice to show in
what vein these world-riddles are worked out. “We are endued with two
natures, one of which is human or mortal, and subject to chemical change,
commonly termed dissolution or death; the other, immortal or spiritual, capable
of adding to itself by an inherent power to comprehend the nature, qualities and
capabilities of all created visible things, which comprehension signifies the
reconversion of all material existences into true ideas.” “It is an absolute
fact that <em>everything is literal</em>. To the spiritual man symbols are literal; they
are indeed more literal than the natural man considers what he terms facts or
realities.“ ”<em>The ultimate atom is Spirit.</em> Finite wills are points on which the
Infinite Will acts, for no creature can will without being a manifestation of the
Supreme Intelligence who first wills that it shall will.“</p>

<p class='c028'>The subsequent portion of the book deals partly with an expansion of the
general tenets laid down in these seven chapters, and their application to the
present <em>practical</em> needs of the world; partly with prophetic utterances as to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>near approach of an awakening of the peoples to their real position as members
of one great Spiritual community. Under the first heading a very important
document is presented to the world, being a form for enrolment in the
“Universal Rights Support Association,” which if generally adopted in the true
spirit would indeed herald the millennium. Under the second heading in
Chapter XIII. a remarkable reading of part of the Apocalypse is given,
commencing with the words from Daniel, “and at that time shall Michael stand
up, the great Prince which standeth for the children of the people: and there
shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation even to
that same time: At that time the people shall be delivered, every one that shall
be found written in the book.” Such words as these are not to be understood
on the first reading, and indeed will probably meet with nothing but derision
from many. Yet <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> will see in them another and a most powerful battery
opened against the powers of darkness to wage war with which is his own chief
mission.</p>

<p class='c028'>In conclusion I can only add that, in my humble opinion, few men have shown
such courage in facing the ridicule of society as Captain Serjeant, and that he
has chosen to risk the forfeiture of a place in social circles to which his right
is undeniable, rather than give way to the temptation to prophesy smooth things.
He is one of the foremost in the New Dispensation movement, and a man whose
working power must be enormous, if it be measured by the labours which he
daily and voluntarily undertakes. His peculiar style of writing lays him open
to the accusation of calling himself the coming Messiah. If his accusers would
only meet him face to face, they would find that no man is humbler than he, and
none is more fully conscious nor more loudly proclaims that “individuality is
but an emanation from the one Great Spirit,” in which alone he recognises the
true Christ, the Saviour of the world. He would tell them that in <em>themselves</em> is
incarnate the Spirit of Wisdom, and that it only awaits its union with the Spirit
of Love, to manifest itself as the Spirit of Truth. How little he values his own
personality and his own well-being or fame, those who know him best can testify.
If Theosophy is to be a living thing, and not a mere intellectual amusement, it
is by such men as this that it must be followed. Were there many such the
world would soon be freed from its misery, by the force of their united volition.
Verily their reward is at hand.</p>

<h4 class='c023'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">TRAITÉ ÉLÉMENTAIRE DE SCIENCE OCCULTE, par <span class='sc'>Papus</span>.</span></h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c034'>
    <div>Published by Georges Carré, 58, Rue St Audré des Arts.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c028'>This, the latest of the admirable publications now being issued by M.
Georges Carré, under the auspices of “L’Isis,” the French branch of the
Theosophical Society, deserves a hearty welcome at the hands of all students of
Occultism, as it fulfils the promise of its title, which is high praise indeed.</p>

<p class='c028'>The book is written and constructed on correct Occult principles; it contains
seven chapters, three devoted to theory and four to the application and
practical illustration of that theory.</p>

<p class='c028'>After an eloquent introductory chapter, M. Papus proceeds to lead his readers
by easy transitions into the mysterious science of numbers. This—the first key
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>to <em>practical</em> Occultism—is at once the simplest and the most subtle of sciences.
Hitherto there has existed no really elementary exposition of its primary,
fundamental principles. And, as this science of numbers lies at the base of
every one of those applications of occult science which are still to any extent
studied, a knowledge of it is almost indispensable.</p>

<p class='c028'>Astrology, Chiromancy, Cartomancy, in short, all the arts of divination, rest
ultimately on numbers and their occult powers, as a foundation.</p>

<p class='c028'>And yet, though the students of each of these several arts must, perforce,
acquire a certain knowledge of numerical science, yet very few of them possess
that knowledge in a systematic and co-ordinated form.</p>

<p class='c028'>Of course M. Papus does not, and cannot, give anything like a complete textbook
on the subject, but he does give, in clear language, the fundamental
guiding principles of this science. Moreover, he illustrates the methods of
numerical working, by numerous and well-chosen examples—an aid which is
simply invaluable to the student who is making his first entrance into this field
of study. In the third chapter these abstract formulæ are given as they relate to
man, as an individual, and as a member of that larger whole, called humanity.
This completes the purely theoretical portion of the book, and in the fourth
chapter we are shown how these general principles work in their application.</p>

<p class='c028'>Signs and symbols are proved to be the <em>natural</em> expressions of ideas in
accordance with fixed laws, and the method is applied by way of illustration to
the interpretation of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus. The relation
between number and form is shown as exhibited in geometrical figures, and M.
Papus gives a clue to a subject which has puzzled many—the actual <em>influence</em> in
life of <em>names</em>. This chapter is most enthralling, but lack of space forbids any
detailed comments, for so much would have to be said.</p>

<p class='c028'>Chapters five and six are almost equally interesting; full of lucid illustration
and valuable hints to the practical student, they form almost a manual in themselves.
But on one point M. Papus is certainly in error, though, since it is on a matter
of history, its importance is relatively small. He attaches <em>far</em> too much weight
to the Jews and to their national system of occultism—the Kabbala. True,
that system is the most familiar in Europe; but it has been so much overlaid
by a semi-esoteric veil, and additions and interpolations by Christian Occultists,
that its inner grossness is lost sight of; so that students are apt to be led
away from the truth, and to form erroneous conceptions as to the value and
meaning of many symbols, the importance of which in practical work is very
great. What esoteric knowledge the Jews possessed, they derived either from
the Egyptians or the Babylonians during the captivity. Hence M. Saint-Ives
d’Alvidre, his gigantic erudition notwithstanding, is altogether mistaken in the
stress he lays on their knowledge, their place in history and their mission as a
nation. This, however, is but a matter of small moment in a book, the practical
value of which it would be difficult to over-estimate.</p>

<h4 class='c023'>THE NEW WAGNER JOURNAL.</h4>

<p class='c035'>We have received from Mr. Geo. Redway, Publisher, 15, York Street, W.C.,
the prospectus of a new Journal, “<span class='sc'>The Meister</span>,” which is about to be edited
for the <cite>Richard Wagner Society</cite> by Mr. Wm. Ashton Ellis, author of “Theosophy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>in the Works of Richard Wagner” (Theosophical Society’s Transactions),
and of “Richard Wagner as Poet, Musician and Mystic,” read before the
Society of Fine Arts. As Mr. Ellis is a member of the Committee of the
Wagner Society, and a member of Council of the London Lodge of the
Theosophical Society, we hope that prominence will be given to the esoteric
side of Richard Wagner’s works; and for this hope we have justification not
only in the pamphlets above alluded to but also in the words of the prospectus
of the <span class='sc'>Meister</span>. “Religion, Art, and Social Questions are in these works
(Wagner’s) presented to his readers under novel aspects, and such as are of
the greatest interest to a generation which is eagerly scanning the horizon for
some cloud which may be the harbinger of refreshing rain long looked for to
quench the thirst of the arid sands of Materialistic Science.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The prospectus presents us with a specimen of the cover of the journal, designed
by Mr. Percy Anderson, an artist who has already made a name for
himself in other walks of the decorative art, and whose first attempt in this
direction shows great power of broad effects of light and shade, and considerable
expertness in symbolism. We hope in our next issue to review the first
number of the <span class='sc'>Meister</span> which, we understand, will appear on the 13th inst.
It will be published for the present <em>quarterly</em>, at the subscription rate of 4s. per
annum, but we trust that it may shortly become a full-fledged “monthly.”</p>

<h4 class='c023'>AUTOCENTRICISM.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c013'><sup>[183]</sup></a></h4>

<p class='c035'>Man has made God in his own image. Taking his thoughts and passions, fears,
hope and aspirations, with part thereof he endows his fellow-men, whose natures
he knows only as figured and interpreted by his own, and thus he becomes a
social being; with part thereof he inspires the inanimate world—“the sun,
the moon, the stars, the sea, the hills, and the plains,” and thus he becomes a
poet; “with the residue” he forms his God, and “falleth down unto it, and
worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God.”</p>

<p class='c028'>The first of these processes is legitimate, indeed necessary, for there is
a foundation of unity in human nature, however diverse and complex are
its varied developments; and the humanity which dwells in all can recognize
itself under strange disguises.</p>

<p class='c028'>The second process is innocent and elevating, so long as it is kept within
just limits, and claims to reach results subjectively, not objectively, true.</p>

<p class='c028'>The third process is inevitable at a certain stage of racial evolution, but
beyond that stage becomes absolutely noxious and degrading, because it
extols as truth that which conscience and reason have begun to condemn as
untruth.</p>

<p class='c028'>Dead are the Gods of Egypt, those supreme plutocrats, under whom costly
mummification and burial in a sculptured tomb were the conditions of
posthumous life, so that a poor man could by no means enter into the kingdom
of Osiris. Dead are Jupiter, Apollo, Pallas, Aphrodite, the products and
reflexes of Greek majesty, beauty and intellect; or, if not dead, they are
immortalised only by the art of their human creators. Dead, or dying, as a
power to be loved and feared, is that Jehovah who reproduces the cruelty,
selfishness and stubbornness of the typical Jew, with his substratum of conscience,
showing itself from time to time in a more or less wrong-headed zeal
for righteousness.</p>

<p class='c028'>In its infancy, every race unconsciously forms an ideal, and makes this ideal
its God. As the race grows in civilisation the ideal is modified, and for some
time the god continues to undergo corresponding changes, and is, so to speak,
kept up to date. But increasing experience and knowledge bring increasing
secularism of thought and feeling, and incapacitate the mind for reconstructing
its Divinity. Religion loses its life-blood. In this stage, the <a id='corr502.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Deitry'>Deity</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_502.35'><ins class='correction' title='Deitry'>Deity</ins></a></span> is either
an anachronism, incompatible with the highest instincts of his worshippers,
and therefore holding them back morally and intellectually, or else he becomes
a nonentity, an abstraction, which can have no influence on life and conduct.
It is this effete conception which Dr. Lewins combats in the tract <a id='corr502.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='entitles'>entitled</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_502.39'><ins class='correction' title='entitles'>entitled</ins></a></span>
“Autocentricism, or the Brain Theory of Life and Mind.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Man, in brief, is his own God. Saints and mystics, and all the most beautiful
souls of all religions, have seen this truth as in a glass darkly. Christ
expressed it in mystic form when he said, “The Kingdom of Heaven is
within you,” and, “I and my Father are one.” But in Christ’s time Animism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>was so ingrained in human nature that it was impossible he could escape it.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c013'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
He had not the scientific data on which to found a true cosmology; and even
had he possessed the data, he would have lacked the power to use them.
Scientific habits of thought were necessarily alien to the mind of the Galilean
peasant.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c013'><sup>[185]</sup></a> He could <em>feel</em> rather than <em>comprehend</em> the unity of God, Man, and
the World; but he could not know that this unity is centred in the thought-cells
of the cerebral hemispheres, and that the Divine glory is the offspring of
a material organism.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c013'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Scientific synthesis can now give a solid basis to Christian
and Buddhist mysticism, to Berkleyan and Kantian Idealism, by declaring that
the brain is the one phenomenon which certifies <a id='corr503.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it'>its</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_503.10'><ins class='correction' title='it'>its</ins></a></span> own nomenal existence.
It thinks, therefore it is; it creates, therefore it exists. Yet Dualism is condemned,
whatever stand-point we adopt. “For my main argument ... it
matters not a jot or tittle whether you proceed on the nöetic or hyloic <a id='corr503.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='basis'>basis.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_503.13'><ins class='correction' title='basis'>basis.</ins></a></span>
A European ought to take the latter, which admits of <a id='corr503.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='scintific'>scientific</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_503.14'><ins class='correction' title='scintific'>scientific</ins></a></span> research and
discovery. An Asiatic or African, who has not the genius for original
realistic research, may safely be left to the former.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c013'><sup>[187]</sup></a> Beyond himself, no
man can think. We are apt to be deluded by the exigencies of language, and
to look upon “our” ideas, “our” imaginations, as in some way separable from
ourselves; as possessions rather than components of the Ego. Yet nothing
is clearer than that the sum of these sentient states actually <em>constitutes</em> the Ego,
so far as it knows itself; and that a “dominant” idea, engrossing the attention
to the exclusion of all others, is for the time absolutely identical with and
equivalent to the mind which it is said to “rule.” For moments which are
eternities, because the sense of time is abolished, the musician may be
“absorbed in” or identified with his sonata, the poet with his verse, the mystic
with his vision of the Divine Essence. “I am as great as God, and He
as small as I,” sings Angelus Silesius; but we may rather say that in such
states of rapture the <a id='corr503.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='relatious'>relations</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_503.28'><ins class='correction' title='relatious'>relations</ins></a></span> of “great” and “small,” of “internal” and
“external,” of “space” and “infinitude,” of “time” and “eternity,” are
annihilated, and the whole universe fused into one point of light.</p>

<p class='c028'>This feeling, rationalised and stripped of mystery, though not of wonder and
solemnity, is the truth and life of Hylo-Idealism. Worship is done away
with, not by iconoclasm, but by apotheosis. “By it we are, indeed, for ever
and entirely relieved from the humiliating and overwhelming sense of human
insignificance, thus making ourselves quite at home in the more than terrestrial
grandeurs of the universe, in which our planet is but a sand-grain.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c013'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>In conclusion, I should like to recommend Dr. Lewins’s tractate, with its
Introduction by Mr. Courtney, and its succinct and luminous Appendix by
G. M. Mc., and also Mr. Courtney’s articles reprinted from “Our Corner” to
the attention of all sincere souls. Hylo-Idealism, or “Autocentricism,” has
the merit of not being negative merely, but also positive and constructive,
substituting for the “renunciation” preached by Christ and Buddha, a perfect
fulfilment of self, and conquering selfishness by self-expansion. It is thus
especially potent in the fields of theoretical and practical ethics, indeed the
central idea of Spinoza’s admirable and still unsurpassed analysis of the
Passions is distinctly deducible from our thesis, though generally regarded as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>an excrescence rather than a natural growth from his own. Upon all this I
cannot, at present, dwell, but must content myself with the bare indication of
fields of thought and action which are “white already to the harvest.”</p>

They failed to produce the desired effect, but they were, in no sense of the
word, “miracles.” It was supposed that intelligent people, especially men of
science, would, at least, have recognised the existence of a new and deeply
interesting field of enquiry and research when they witnessed physical effects
produced at will, for which they were not able to account. It was supposed that
theologians would have welcomed the proof, of which they stand so sadly in
need in these agnostic days, that the soul and the spirit are not mere creations
of their fancy, due to ignorance of the physical constitution of man, but entities
quite as real as the body, and much more important. These expectations were
not realized. The phenomena were misunderstood and misrepresented, both
as regards their nature and their purpose.</p>

<p class='c028'>In the light which experience has now thrown upon the matter the explanation
of this unfortunate circumstance is not far to seek. Neither science nor
religion acknowledges the existence of the Occult, as the term is understood and
employed in theosophy; in the sense, that is to say, of a super-material, but not
super-natural, region, governed by law; nor do they recognise the existence of
latent powers and possibilities in man. Any interference with the every-day
routine of the material world is attributed, by religion, to the arbitrary will of a
good or an evil autocrat, inhabiting a supernatural region inaccessible to man,
and subject to no law, either in his actions or constitution, and for a knowledge
of whose ideas and wishes mortals are entirely dependent upon inspired communications
delivered through an accredited messenger. The power of working
so-called miracles has always been deemed the proper and sufficient credentials
of a messenger from heaven, and the mental habit of regarding any occult power
in that light is still so strong that any exercise of that power is supposed to be
“miraculous,” or to claim to be so. It is needless to say that this way of
regarding extraordinary occurrences is in direct opposition to the scientific
spirit of the age, nor is it the position practically occupied by the more intelligent
portion of mankind at present. When people see wonders, nowadays, the
sentiment excited in their minds is no longer veneration and awe, but curiosity.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was in the hope of arousing and utilizing this spirit of curiosity that occult
phenomena were shown. It was believed that this manipulation of forces of
nature which lie below the surface—that surface of things which modern science
scratches and pecks at so industriously and so proudly—would have led to enquiry
into the nature and the laws of those forces, unknown to science, but perfectly
known to occultism. That the phenomena did excite curiosity in the minds of
those who witnessed them, is certainly true, but it was, unfortunately, for the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>part of an idle kind. The greater number of the witnesses developed an
insatiable appetite for phenomena for their own sake, without any thought of
studying the philosophy or the science of whose truth and power the phenomena
were merely trivial and, so to say, accidental illustrations. In but a few
cases the curiosity which was awakened gave birth to the serious desire to study
the philosophy and the science themselves and for their own sake.</p>

<p class='c028'>Experience has taught the leaders of the movement that the vast majority of
professing Christians are absolutely precluded by their mental condition and
attitude—the result of centuries of superstitious teaching—from calmly examining
the phenomena in their aspect of natural occurrences governed by law. The
Roman Catholic Church, true to its traditions, excuses itself from the
examination of any occult phenomena on the plea that they are necessarily the
work of the Devil, whenever they occur outside of its own pale, since it has a
lawful monopoly of the legitimate miracle business. The Protestant Church
denies the personal intervention of the Evil One on the material plane; but,
never having gone into the miracle business itself, it is apparently a little
doubtful whether it would know a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bona-fide</i></span> miracle if it saw one, but, being just
as unable as its elder sister to conceive the extension of the reign of law
beyond the limits of matter and force, as known to us in our present state of
consciousness, it excuses itself from the study of occult phenomena on the plea
that they lie within the province of science rather than of religion.</p>

<p class='c028'>Now science has its miracles as well as the Church of Rome. But, as it is
altogether dependent upon its instrument maker for the production of these
miracles, and, as it claims to be in possession of the last known word in regard
to the laws of nature, it was hardly to be expected that it would take very kindly
to “miracles,” in whose production apparatus has no part, and which claim to be
instances of the operation of forces and laws of which it has no knowledge.
Modern science, moreover, labours under disabilities with respect to the investigation
of the Occult quite as embarrassing as those of Religion; for, while
Religion cannot grasp the idea of natural law as applied to the supersensuous
Universe, Science does not allow the existence of any supersensuous universe
at all to which the reign of law could be extended; nor can it conceive the
possibility of any other state of consciousness than our present terrestrial one.
It was, therefore, hardly to be expected that science would undertake the task
it was called upon to perform with much earnestness and enthusiasm; and,
indeed, it seems to have felt that it was not expected to treat the phenomena of
occultism less cavalierly than it had treated divine miracles. So it calmly proceeded
at once to pooh-pooh the phenomena; and, when obliged to express
some kind of opinion, it did not hesitate, without examination, and on hearsay
reports, to attribute them to fraudulent contrivances—wires, trap-doors and so
forth.</p>

<p class='c028'>It was bad enough for the leaders of the movement, when they endeavoured
to call the attention of the world to the great and unknown field for scientific
and religious enquiry which lies on the borderland between matter and spirit,
to find themselves set down as agents of his Satanic Majesty, or as superior
adepts in the charlatan line; but the unkindest cut of all, perhaps, came from a
class of people whose own experiences, rightly understood, ought certainly to
have taught them better: the occult phenomena were claimed by the Spiritualists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>as the work of their dear departed ones, but the leaders in Theosophy
were declared to be somewhat less even than mediums in disguise.</p>

<p class='c028'>Never were the phenomena presented in any other character than that of
instances of a power <em>over perfectly natural though unrecognised forces</em>, and
incidentally over matter, possessed by certain individuals who have attained to
a larger and higher knowledge of the Universe than has been reached by scientists
and theologians, or can ever be reached by them, by the roads they are now
respectively pursuing. Yet this power is latent in all men, and could, in time,
be wielded by anyone who would cultivate the knowledge and conform to the
conditions necessary for its development. Nevertheless, except in a few isolated
and honourable instances, never was it received in any other character than
as would-be miracles, or as works of the Devil, or as vulgar tricks, or as
amusing gape-seed, or as the performances of those dangerous “spooks” that
masquerade in séance rooms, and feed on the vital energies of mediums and
sitters. And, from all sides, theosophy and theosophists were attacked with a
rancour and bitterness, with an absolute disregard alike of fact and logic, and
with malice, hatred and uncharitableness that would be utterly inconceivable,
did not religious history teach us what mean and unreasoning animals ignorant
men become when their cherished prejudices are touched; and did not the
history of scientific research teach us, in its turn, how very like an ignorant man
a learned man can behave, when the truth of his theories is called in question.</p>

<p class='c028'>An occultist can produce phenomena, but he cannot supply the world with
brains, nor with the intelligence and good faith necessary to understand and
appreciate them. Therefore, it is hardly to be wondered at, that <em>word</em> came to
abandon phenomena and let the ideas of Theosophy stand on their own intrinsic
merits.</p>

</div>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c032'>[The editors have received the two following
letters—one from the learned
Founder of Hylo-Idealism, the other from
a gentleman, a casual correspondent, of
whom they know <em>absolutely nothing</em> except
his most extraordinary way of expressing
his thoughts in words and terms
hitherto unheard by ordinary mortals.
Both take the editors to task for using
their undeniable right of criticism and
editorial judgment. As <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span>, however,
is a magazine <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span>, and as its
policy is the greatest possible tolerance
and fairness to all parties concerned, it
will abstain from its legal prerogative of
leaving the letters without reply or notice.
<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> hands them over, therefore, to
the “<span class='sc'>Adversary</span>,” to be dealt with according
to their respective merits. The
editors have never pretended to an
“understanding of Hylo-Idealism” nor
do they entertain any such rash hope for
the future. They belong to that humble
class of mortals who labour to their dying
day under the belief that 2 × 2 = 4, and
can by no means, even hylo-idealistic,
make 5. “C. N.”’s letter placed the new
“philosophy” in an entirely different
light; firstly, because it is written in good
English, and because the style of the
writer is extremely attractive; and secondly,
because at least one point has now
been made clear to the editors: “Hylo-Idealism”
is, like modern spiritualism, the
<em>essence of transcendental materialism</em>. If
in Mr. Huxley’s opinion Comte’s Positivism
is, in practice, “Catholicism <em>minus</em>
Christianity,” in the views of the editors
of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> Hylo-Idealism is “Metaphysics
<em>minus</em> psychology and—<em>physics</em>.”
Let its apostles explain away its flagrant
contradictions, and then <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> will be
the first to render justice to it as a philosophy.
Meanwhile, it can only acknowledge
a number of remarkably profound
thoughts that are to be found scattered in
independent solitude throughout the
letters of Dr. Lewins (Humanism <i>v.</i>
Theism) and others, and—no more.]</p>

<p class='c028'>Perhaps space may be found in the
February or other early issue of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>interesting and suggestive serial for the
present curt communication. In a footnote
of your January number I am
coupled with Mr. H. Spencer as being more
Atheist than Moleschott and Büchner—to
say nothing of such compromising and
irresolute scientists as Darwin, Huxley,
and Co. Now, that atheistic or non-animist
standpoint is the pivot on which
my whole synthesis revolves; and is, I
contend, the burning problem at this
epoch—ethical and intellectual—of the
human mind—<em>thoroughly</em> to establish
on certain concrete, rational and
scientific <em>data</em>, that is to say—not on the
Utopias of Speculation and Metaphysics.
My principle is exactly that of Kant (inter
alios) when he formulates the “Thing in
Itself.” But we have only to study the
short and handy “Critique of Kant,”
referred to in your columns—by Kuno
Fischer, translated by Dr. Hough, to see
how fast and loose that “all-shattering”
metaphysician played with his all-destructive
theme. Not only does he entirely
reverse it and its corollaries in his
critique of the “Practical Reason,” and
of “Judgment,” but also in the second
edition of the “Critique of Pure Reason”
itself, in which originally, as its corollary,
or rather concomitant, he, like myself,
only on less sure premises, disposes of
God, the Soul (Anima or Vital Principle),
and Immortality—that is of another “personal”
life after death. I hold with
Lucretius, Epicurus, and others in ancient
and modern times, of whom Shelley is a
typical case, that no greater benefit can
be bestowed on humanity than the elimination
from sane thought of this
ghastly and maddening Triune Spectre.
God alone is quite <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“l’infame”</span> Voltaire
dubs the Catholic Church. Looking
through Nature “red in tooth and claws”
to its <em>pseudo</em> Author, we must expect to
find a <em>Pandemon</em>. For any omnipotent
Being who, unconditioned and unfettered
in all respects, “<em>willed</em>” such a world of
pain and anguish for sentient creatures,
must be a Demon <em>worse</em> than mythology
has fabled of Satan, Moloch, Mammon,
or other fiends. It must be noted that in
the classic Pantheon, the Fates, or Fatal
Sisters, are “above” all the Immortals
of Olympus, including Jove himself—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>saving provision quite inadmissible in

<p class='c028'>I have to thank you for your kind insertion
of my note on above in January issue
of the Magazine.</p>

<p class='c028'>I have not the slightest desire to quarrel
with your prefaced comments on my style
of writing. It seems to you to be “turgid,”
and you take advantage of some unkind
epithets lately dealt out to Theosophy in
the <cite>Secular Review</cite> to return the compliment
to me with interest added. Be it so.
It would seem but fair to, let me say,
compliment those, and those only, who
have directly complimented you; but I
have no wish, as I have just said, to find
fault with <em>any</em> comment on Hylo-Idealism
or on the methods of its advocacy. <em>All</em>
criticism is, I know, received by the excogitator
of the system with thanks, and,
save that both he and I think your note
<i>re “Theobroma”</i> not a little at fault (for
explanation I refer you to the well-known
Messrs. Epps), I can say the same for myself.</p>

<p class='c028'>I can see, however, in spite of the
raillery with which you honour us, that a
right understanding of Hylo-Idealism—I
beg pardon, <em>High-low</em> Idealism—is still
very far from being yours. Why, in a
recent issue of <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> the old difficulty
of, as I call it, the “Coincident assumption
of Materiality” is started as if it had
never before been thought of. It is, in
point of fact, fully dealt with in my “Appendix”
to the “Auto-Centricism” pamphlet,
which has already passed under
your review! It is not worth while to
enter once more upon this point; suffice
it then to say, in addition, that I explained
it also, at full length, to a Theosophical
writer—Mr. E. D. Fawcett—in the <cite>Secular
Review</cite>, some months ago. He had
started the same venerable objection, but
after my reply, he so far honoured me as
not to return to the charge. Let him do
so now, and then a Theosophical attack
and a Hylo-Ideal defence will be before
you. But, really, it is no argument
against my position to extract some half-dozen
lines of my writing from a contemporary
and to follow this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>soupçon</i></span> with
three printer’s “shrieks.”</p>

<p class='c028'>I shall wait with interest the promised
letter from “C. N.,” placing Hylo-Idealism
in a “new and very different light,” as you
say. This is something quite new. Dr.
Lewins, C. N., and I have, none of us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>been able, hitherto, to find any material
difference between our several presentations
of the system.</p>

  </div>

<h4 class='c023'>TO DR. LEWINS, AND THE HYLO-IDEALISTS&nbsp;AT LARGE.</h4>

<p class='c035'>The several learned gentlemen of the
above persuasion, who have honoured
<span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> with their letters and articles,
will please to accept the present as a collective
Reply. Life is too short to
indulge very often in such lengthy explanations.
But <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“une fois n’est pas
coutume.”</span></p>

<p class='c028'>In “coupling” Dr. Lewins’ name with
those he mentions—especially with Mr.
Herbert Spencer’s—the Editors had
assuredly no intention of saying anything
derogatory to the dignity of the founder
of Hylo-Idealism. They have called the
latter system—its qualification of <em>Idealistic</em>
notwithstanding——“atheistical,” and to
this Dr. Lewins himself does not demur.
Quite the contrary. If his protest
(against a casual remark made in a footnote
of two lines!) means anything at
all, it means that he feels hurt to find his
name associated with the names of such
“compromising and (in <em>atheism</em>) irresolute
scientists as Darwin, Huxley, and Co.”
What is it that our erudite correspondent
demurs to, then? Just that, and nothing
more. His prefixed adjectives refer to
the half-heartedness of these gentlemen
in the matter of atheism and materialism,
not surely, to their scientific achievements.
Indeed, these illustrious naturalists are
timid enough to leave half-opened doors
in their speculations for something to
enter in which is not quite matter, and
yet what it is they do not, or <em>do not wish</em> to
know.</p>

<p class='c028'>Indeed, they derive man, his origin and
consciousness, <em>only</em> from the lower forms
of animal creation and the brutes, instead
of attributing life, mind and intellect—as
the followers of the new System do—simply
to the pranks played by <em>Prakriti</em>
(the great Ignorance and Illusion) on our
“diseased nervous centres”—<em>abstract
thought</em> being synonymous with <em>Neuropathy</em>
in the teachings of the Hylo-Idealists
(see <cite>Auto-Centricism</cite>, p. 40).
But all this has been already said and
<em>better said</em> by Kapila, in his <cite>Sankhya</cite>, and
is very old philosophy indeed; so that
Messrs. Darwin and Co. have been, perhaps,
wise in their generation to adopt
another theory. Our great Darwinists are
practical men, and avoid running after the
hare and the eagle at the same time, as
the hare in such case would be sure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>run away, and the eagle to be lost in the
clouds. They prefer to ignore the ideas
and conceptions of the Universe, as held
by such “loose,” and—as philosophically
expressed by our <em>uncompromising</em>
opponent—“all-shattering metaphysicians
as Kant was.” Therefore letting all such
“metaphysical crack-brained theories”
severely alone, they made man and his
thinking <em>Ego</em> the lineal descendant of the
revered ancestor of the now tailless
baboon, our beloved and esteemed first
cousin. This is only logical <em>from the
Darwinian standpoint</em>. What is, then,
Dr. Lewins’ quarrel with these great men,
or with us? They have their theory, the
inventor of Hylo-Idealism has his theory,
we, Metaphysicians, have our ideas and
theories; and, the <em>Moon</em> shining with impartial
and equal light on the respective
occiputs of Hylo-Idealists, Animalists,
and Metaphysicians, she pours material
enough for every one concerned to allow
each of them to “live and let live.” No
man can be at once a Materialist and an
Idealist, and remain consistent. Eastern
philosophy and occultism are based on
the <em>absolute unity</em> of the Root Substance,
and they recognise only one infinite and
universal <span class='sc'>Cause</span>. The Occultists are <span class='sc'>Unitarians</span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span>. But there is such
a thing as conventional, time-honoured
terms with one and the same meaning
attached to them all—at any rate on
this plane of illusion. And if we want to
understand each other, we are forced to
use such terms in their generally-accepted
sense, and avoid calling mind matter, and
vice versâ. The definition of a <i>materialised
“Spirit”</i> as frozen whiskey is in its place
in a humouristic pun: it becomes an
absurdity in philosophy. It is Dr. Lewins’
argument that “the very first principle of
logic is, that two ‘causes’ are not to
be thought of when one is sufficient;”
and though the first and the ultimate, the
Alpha and the Omega in the existence of
the Universe, is one absolute cause, yet,
on the plane of manifestations and differentiations,
matter, as phenomenon, and
Spirit as noumenon, cannot be so loosely
confused as to merge the latter into the
former, under the pretext that one self-evident
natural cause (however secondary
in the sight of logic and reason) is “sufficient
for our purpose,” and we need not
“transcend the proper conditions of
thought” and fall back upon the lower
level of “lawless and uncertain fancy”—i.e.,
metaphysics. (<i>Vide</i> “Humanism <i>v.</i>
Theism,” pp. 14, 15.)</p>

<p class='c028'>We have nothing whatever, I say it
again, against “Hylo-Idealism” with
the exception of its compound and
self-contradictory name. Nor do we
oppose Dr. Lewins’ earlier thoughts, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>embodied in “C. N’s” “<span class='fss'>HUMANISM</span> <em>versus</em>
<span class='fss'>THEISM</span>.” That which we permit ourselves
to object to and oppose is the later
system grown into a <em>Bifrontian</em>, Janus-like
monster, a hybrid <em>duality</em> notwithstanding
its forced mask of Unity. Surely it is
not because Dr. Lewins calls “Spirit—a
<em>fiction</em>” and attributes Mind, Thought,
Genius, Intellect, and all the highest
attributes of thinking man to simple
effects or functions of Hylo-zoism, that
the greatest problem of psychology, <em>the
relation of mind to matter</em>, is solved? No
one can accuse “The Adversary” of too
much tenderness or even regard for the
conclusions of such rank materialists as
the Darwinians generally are. But surely
no impartial man would attribute their
constant failure to explain the relations
of mind to matter, and the confessions of
their ignorance of the ultimate constitution
of that matter itself, to timidity and
irresoluteness, but rather to the right
cause: <i>i.e.</i>, the <em>absolute impossibility of
explaining spiritual effects by physical
causes</em>, in the first case; and the presence
of that in matter which baffles and mocks
the efforts of the physical senses to perceive
or feel, and therefore to explain it,
in the second case. It is not, evidently, a
desire to <em>compromise</em> that forced Mr.
Huxley to confess that “in strictness we
(the Scientists) know nothing about the
composition of matter,” but the <em>honesty</em> of
a man of science in not speculating upon
what he did not believe in, and knew
nothing about. Does J. Le Conte insult
the majesty of physical science by
declaring that the creation or destruction,
increase or diminution of matter, “<em>lies
beyond the domain of science?</em>”<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c013'><sup>[190]</sup></a> And to
whose prejudices does Mr. Tyndall pander,
he, who once upon a time shocked the
whole world of believers in spiritual
existence, by declaring in his Belfast
address that in matter alone was “the
promise and potency of every form and
quality of life” (just what Dr. Lewins
does) when he maintains that “the passage
<em>from the physics of the brain to the
corresponding facts of</em> <span class='fss'>CONSCIOUSNESS</span>
<em>is unthinkable</em>,” and adds:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c028'>“Granted that a definite thought and a molecular
action in the brain occur simultaneously;
we do not possess the intellectual organ nor
apparently any rudiments of the organ, which
would enable us to pass by a process of
reasoning from one to the other. They appear
together, but <em>we do not know why</em>. Were our
minds and senses so expanded, strengthened and
illuminated, as to enable us to see and feel the
very molecules of the brain; were we capable of
following all their motions, all their groupings,
all their electric discharges, if such there be; and
were we intimately acquainted with the corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>states of thought and feeling, we should
be as far as ever from the solution of the problem.
‘How are these physical processes connected
with the facts of consciousness?’ The chasm
between the two classes of phenomena would still
remain intellectually impassable.”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c013'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>To our surprise, however, we find that
our learned correspondent—Tyndall,
Huxley &amp; Co., notwithstanding—has
passed the <em>intellectually impassable</em>
chasm by modes of perception, “anti-intellectual,”
so to speak. I say this in
no impertinent mood; but merely following
Dr. Lewins on his own lines of
thought. As his expressions seem absolutely
antiphrastic in meaning to those
generally accepted by the common herd,
“anti-intellectual” would mean with the
Hylo-Idealists “anti-spiritual” (spirit
being a <em>fiction</em> with them). Thus their
Founder must have crossed the impassable
chasm—say, by a hylo-zoistic process
of perception, “starting from the region of
rational cogitation” and not from “that
lower level of lawless and uncertain fancy,”
as Theosophists, Mystics, and other <em>hoi
polloi</em> of thought, do. He has done it to
his own “mental satisfaction,” and this is
all a Hylo-Idealist will ever aspire to, as
Dr. Lewins himself tells us. He “cannot
deny that there may be <em>behind</em> (?) nature
a ‘cause of causes,’<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c013'><sup>[192]</sup></a> but if so, it is a god
who hides himself, or itself, from mortal
thought. Nature is at all events vice-regent
plenipotentiary, and with <em>her</em>
thought has alone to deal.” Just so, and
we say it too, for reasons given in the footnote.
“There is a natural solution for
everything,” he adds. “Of course, if there
be no ‘cause,’ this solution is the arrangement
and co-ordination of invariable
sequences in our own minds ... rather
than an ‘explanation’ or ‘accounting for’
phenomena. Properly speaking we can
‘account for’ nothing. <em>Mental satisfaction</em>—unity
between microcosm and
macrocosm, not the search after ‘First
Causes.’ ... is the true chief end of
man.” (Hum. <i>v.</i> Theism, p. 15.)</p>

<p class='c028'>This seems the backbone of Hylo-Idealistic
philosophy, which thus appears
as a cross breed between Epicurianism
and the “Illusionism” of the Buddhist
Yogachâras. This stands proven by the
contradictions in his system. Dr. Lewins
seems to have achieved that, to do which
every mortal scientist has hitherto failed,
firstly, by declaring (in Hum. <i>v.</i> Theism,
p. 17) the whole objective world—“<em>phenomenal</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>or <em>ideal</em>”,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c013'><sup>[193]</sup></a> and “everything in it
<em>spectral</em>” (Auto-Centricism, p. 9), and yet
<em>admitting the reality of matter</em>. More
than this. In the teeth of all the scientific
luminaries, from Faraday to Huxley, who
all confess to knowing <span class='fss'>NOTHING</span> of matter,
he declares that—“Matter organic and
inorganic <em>is now fully known</em>” (Auto-Centricism,
p. 40)!!</p>

<p class='c028'>I humbly beg Dr. Lewins’ pardon for
the rude question; but does he really
mean to say what he does say? Does he
want his readers to believe that up to his
appearance in this world of matter, thinking
men did not know what they were
talking about, and that among all the
“Ego Brains” of this globe his brain is
the one omniscient <em>reality</em>, while all others
are empty phantasms,or <em>spectral</em> balloons?
Besides which, matter cannot surely be
<em>real</em> and <em>unreal</em> at the same time. If
<em>unreal</em>—and he maintains it—then all
Science can know about it is that it
knows <em>nothing</em>, and this is precisely what
Science confesses. And if <em>real</em>—and
Dr. Lewins, as shown, declares it likewise—then
his <em>Idealism</em> goes upside
down, and <em>Hylo</em> alone remains to mock
him and his philosophy. These may be
trifling considerations in the consciousness
of an <em>Ego</em> of Dr. Lewins’ power, but they
are very serious contradictions, and also
impediments in the way of such humble
thinkers as Vedantins, Logicians, and
Theosophists, toward recognising, let
alone appreciating, “Hylo-Idealism.”
Our learned correspondent pooh-poohs
Metaphysics, and at the same time not
only travels on purely metaphysical
grounds, but adopts and sets forth the
most metaphysical tenets, the very gist of
the <span class='fss'>PARA</span>-metaphysical Vedanta philosophy,
tenets held also by the Buddhist
“Illusionists”—the <em>Yogachâras</em> and
<em>Madhyamikas</em>. Both schools maintain
that all is void (<em>sarva sûnya</em>), or that
which Dr. Lewins calls spectral and
phantasmal. Except internal sensation
or intelligence (<em>vijnâna</em>) the Yogachâras
regard everything else as illusion.
Nothing that is material can have any
but a <em>spectral</em> existence with them. So
far, our “Bauddhas” are at one with <em>the</em>
Hylo-Idealists, but they part at the
crucial moment. The New School teaches
that the Brain (the originator of consciousness)
is the only factor and Creator
of the visible Universe; that in <em>it</em> alone
all our ideas of external things are born,
and that, apart from it, nothing has real
existence, everything being illusion. Now
what has that Brain, or rather the
material its particles and cells are composed
of, distinct in it from other matter
that it should be rendered such honours?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span><em>Physically</em>, it differs very little indeed
from the brain stuff and cranium of any
anthropoid ape. Unless we divorce consciousness,
or the <span class='fss'>EGO</span>, from matter, one
materialistic philosophy is as good as the
other, and none is worth living for. What
his Brain-Ego <em>is</em>, Dr. Lewins does not
show anywhere. He urges that his
“atheistic or <em>non-animist</em> (soulless) standpoint
is the <em>pivot</em>” on which his “whole
synthesis revolves.” But as that “pivot”
is no higher than the physical brain with
its hallucinations, then it must be a
broken reed indeed. A philosophy that
goes no further than superficial Agnosticism,
and says that “what Tennyson
says of Deity <em>may</em> be true, but it is not
in the region of natural cogitation; for it
transcends the logical <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Encheiresis
naturæ</i></span>“ (Hum. <i>v.</i> Theism)—is no
philosophy, but simply <em>unqualified
negation</em>. And one who teaches that
”<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>savants</i></span>, or specialists, are the last to
reach the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>summa scientiæ</i></span>, for the constant
<em>search</em> after knowledge must ever
prevent its <em>fruition</em>” (ibid), cuts the
ground himself under his feet, and thus
loses the right, not only to be considered a
man of science, but likewise his claim to the
title of philosopher, for he rejects all knowledge.
Dr. Lewins, quoting Schiller, “to
the effect that truth can never be reached
while the mind is in its analytic throes,”
shows the poet-philosopher saying that:—“To
capture the fleeting phantom he
(the analyst) must fetter it by rules, must
anatomatise its fair body into concepts,
and imprison <em>its living spirit</em> into a bare
skeleton of words”—and thus brings this
as a prop and proof of his own arguments
that we need not trouble ourselves with
the “cause of causes.” But Schiller
believed in spirit and immortality, while
the Hylo-Idealists deny them <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in toto</i></span>.
What he says above is accepted by every
Occultist and Theosophist, simply because
<em>he refers to the purely intellectual</em> (not
Spiritual) <em>analysis</em> on the physical plane,
and according to the present scientific
methods. Such analysis, of course, will
never help man to reach the real <em>inner</em>
soul-knowledge, but must ever leave him
stranded in the bogs of fruitless speculation.</p>

<p class='c028'>The truth is, that Hylo-Idealism is at
best <span class='fss'>QUIETISM</span>—only on the purely
material plane. “Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die,” seems its motto.
Dr. Lewins tells us that he holds his
views with Epicurus. I beg leave to
contradict again. Epicurus insisted upon
the necessity of making away with an
unphilosophical, anthropomorphic deity—
a bundle of contradictions—and so do we,
the Theosophists. But Epicurus believed
in gods, finite and conditioned in space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>and time, still <em>divine</em> when compared to
objective ephemeral man: again, just as
we, Theosophists, believe in them.</p>

<p class='c028'>We feel sorry to have to say unpleasant
truths. The Founder of Hylo-Idealism is
evidently a marvellously well-read man,
his learning is great and undeniable; and,
we have always had an instinctive respect
for, and sympathy with, thinkers of his
calibre. But, we have been sent pamphlets
and books on Hylo-Idealism for
review, and one would be truant to his
duty to conceal one’s honest and sincere
views on anything. Therefore, we say that,
contradictions and inconsistencies in the
Hylo-Idealistic system apart, we find in it
a mass of ideas and <em>arguments</em> which
come forcibly home to us, because they
are part and parcel of the Eastern
Idealism. Our premises and propositions
seem to be almost identical in some
respects, but the conclusions we come to
disagree in every point, the most important
of which is the true nature of
matter. This, which “has been <em>fabled</em>
as ‘Spirit,’” writes Dr. Lewins in 1878,
“is really merely the ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vis insita</i></span>’ of
matter or ‘nature’—the latter a misnomer
if creation or birth is a delusion, as it
must be on the hypothesis of the eternity
of matter.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Here the Doctor speaks evidently of
“Spirit” from the Christian stand-point,
and criticises it from this aspect. And
from this stand-point and aspect he is
perfectly right; but as wrong from those
of Eastern philosophy. Did he but view
Spirit, <em>as one with eternal matter</em>, which,
though eternal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>in esse</i></span> is but finite and
conditioned during its periodical manifestations,
he would not so materialise its
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vis insita</i></span>—which is <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vis vitæ</i></span> but when
applied to individual manifestations, the
living subjects of illusion, or animated
bodies. But this would lead us too far,
and we must close the subject with one
more protest. There is a casual remark
in “Humanism <i>v.</i> Theisms” to the effect
(on the authority of Ueberweg) that “the
early Greek thinkers and Sages were
Hylo-Zoists.” Aye, learned Doctor; but
the early Greek thinkers understood Hylo-Zoism
(from “<em>Hyle</em>” <em>primordial</em> matter,
or what the greatest chemist in England,
Mr. Crookes, has called “protyle” <em>undifferentiated
matter</em>, and “<em>Zoe</em>,” life) in
a way very different from yours. So are
we, Theosophists and Eastern Occultists,
“Hylo-Zoists”; but it is because with us
“life” is the synonym both of Spirit and
Matter, or the <span class='sc'>One</span> eternal and infinite
<span class='sc'>Life</span> whether manifested or otherwise.
That <span class='sc'>Life</span> is both the eternal <span class='sc'>Idea</span> and
its periodical <span class='sc'>Logos</span>. He who has
grasped and mastered this doctrine completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>has thereby solved the mystery of
<span class='sc'>Being</span>.</p>

do. Thus, <span class='sc'>Lucifer</span> will give one fair

<p class='c028'><span class='sc'>Question</span>, at London, 1887, March 2nd,
6.8 p.m. What will be the duration of
quesited’s life?</p>

<p class='c028'>Though the preceding figure showed
that my relative would recover from his
illness,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c013'><sup>[194]</sup></a> yet it was obvious that the end
could not be far distant; and I drew the
present figure for the minute of the impression,
to interrogate the stars.</p>

<p class='c028'>The following are the elements of the figure:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cusp of 10th house 14 ♊.</div>

      <div class='line in2'>— 3rd house 9 ♏.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Planets’ places are:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♆ 25. 13. 15 ♉.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♅ 11. 37. 30 R. ♎.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♄ 15. 46. 30 R ♋.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♃ 5. 41. 30 R ♏.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♂ 23. 50. 45 ♓.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>☉ 11. 52. 19 ♓.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>♀ 3. 10. 30 ♈.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>☿ 29. 36. 15 ♓.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>☽ 8. 28. 15 ♊.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Caput Draconis 27. 21. 38 ♌.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>⨁  14. 20. 56 I.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c035'>As in the previous figure the 6th house
is the quesited’s 1st, and the 1st house is
his 8th. As the time of the question was
after sunset, ☿ ruling ♏ by night was lord
of his 8th, and ♅ ruling ♒ by night was
lord of his 1st. The aspect of the significators
is ☿ 167° 58’ 45” ♅, separating
from the Quincunx and applying to the
Opposition. The Quincunx is, like the
Conjunction and Parallel, convertible in
nature, being good with benefics and evil
with malefics, and when a benefic and
malefic are thus joined, the stronger rules.
It was therefore in this case doubly evil,
as the significators were separating from
one evil aspect and applying to another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>though not within orbs of either. As
☿, the applying planet, was in a common
sign, and is an angle of the figure, each
degree signified a week; and as 12° 1′
15´´ were wanted to complete the opposition,
the critical period was shown to be
a fraction over 12 weeks, or May 25th.</p>

<p class='c028'>Danger to life was also shown by <em>Cauda
Draconis</em> in quesited’s 1st house; by ☉ in
quesited’s 1st afflicted by a very close
Quincunx of ♅ lord of his 1st, ♅ moreover
receiving ☉ in his Detriment, and
☉ receiving ♅ in his Fall; and by ☽, lady
of quesited’s 6th, posited in his 4th, and
afflicted by a rather close Quartile of ☉
posited in his 1st, ☉ moreover receiving ☽
in his Anti-triplicity (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sit venia verbo</i></span>).
Nevertheless, as the significators were
not actually in any evil aspect, ☿ moreover
receiving ♅ in his Triplicity, and
being almost out of ♓ his Fall and
Detriment, and the Detriment of ♅; ☽,
lady of his 6th, and posited in his 4th,
applying to a Trine of ♅ lord of his 1st;
and ☿ lord of his 8th applying to Conjunction
with ♀ lady of his 4th, ♀
moreover receiving ☿ in her exaltation;—all
this denoted that May 25th would
be the time, not indeed of certain death,
but of imminent danger, the beginning of
the end.</p>

<p class='c028'>⨁ being in the 4th house of the figure,
almost on the cusp, denoted a legacy to
my father.</p>

<p class='c028'>The actual result was as follows: After
having been for some time in fair health,
considering his age and recent illness, <em>he
was suddenly taken ill and in great
danger on the night of May 27th, and on
the morning of May 31st was in articulo
mortis, and given up by his two physicians</em>.
From this, however, he rallied;
relapsed on the night of July 6th; rallied
again; but <em>died on July 19th</em> at 8.30 a.m.,
after a sudden seizure of only 15 minutes’
duration, <em>and my father received a legacy
under his will</em>.</p>

<p class='c028'>The quesited suffered much in his last
illness from cough and dyspnœa. The
certificate of death was—“<em>Primary</em>:
emphysema, morbus cordis. <em>Secondary</em>:
thrombus, syncope.” With this may be
compared ♄ in ♋, having dignity in
quesited’s 8th house, and afflicting ♅ lord
of quesited’s 1st. ♄ in ♋ denotes
“phthisis, ulceration in lungs, obstructions
and bruises in breast, ague, scurvy,
cancer, and cough.”</p>

“Logos,” or the “Heavenly man,” the Tetragrammaton. “The four-lettered Adni (<em>Adonai</em>, “the

<em>end</em> by believing in a Christ of flesh,” or it means nothing. The verb ἐπιτελοῦμαι has not the
meaning of “becoming perfect,” but of “ending by,” becoming so. Paul’s lifelong struggle with
Peter and others, and what he himself tells of his vision of a Spiritual Christ and not of Jesus of
Nazareth, as in the <cite>Acts</cite>—are so many proofs of this.</p>

<p class='c028'><a href='#r177'>177</a>. Does not Paul himself speak of “<em>Principalities</em> and <em>Powers</em> in heavenly places” (Ephesians iii.

<p class='c028'><a href='#r178'>178</a>. Tertullian: “Præscript.” It is undeniably owing only to a remarkably casuistical, sleight-of-hand-like
argument that Jehovah, who in the <em>Kabala</em> is simply a Sephiroth, the third, left-hand
power among the Emanations (Binah), has been elevated to the dignity of the <em>One</em> absolute God.
Even in the Bible he is but one of the <em>Elohim</em> (See Genesis, chapter iii. v. 22. “The Lord God”

<p class='c028'><a href='#r179'>179</a>. This is <em>history</em>. How far that <em>re-writing</em> of, and tampering with, the primitive gnostic fragments
